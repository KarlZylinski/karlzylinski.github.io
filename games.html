<h2>Stingray / Bitsquid Engine</h2>
<img src="images/stingray.jpg" title="Tech demo made for us by Fatshark" alt="Stingray Engine tech demo">

    I worked for around two years at Bitsquid which made a game engine with some pretty neat features such as collaborative editing and fast iteration times. I made mostly tools. Bitsquid was aquired by Autodesk and renamed to Stingray in 2014. Image is from a tech demo created for us by Fatshark.
