        <div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/on_programming_in_elementary_school.html'>May  2, 2017</a><h1>On programming in elementary school</h1><p></p><p>There has been some ideas floating around on Twitter and news sites the past years that it would be a good idea to teach kids how to program computers in elementary school. The motivation for this is is that we live in a world surrounded by technical gadgets and that a deeper understanding for these things could improve our everyday life.</p><p>While I support this idea, I think some people take it a bit too far, without looking at the big picture. Some make is sound like programming should be a big subject next to other, more universal things like language, history and maths. This I do not agree with. Programming is just one part of the tech that surrounds us, but it's easy to forget that there is actually hardware in these things, circuits that have been meticulously designed in order for the software to even have something to run on. There are also other things involved, such as the AC-power leading up to your house, and how that electricity is produced.</p><p>What I'm trying to get at is that, yes we should probably teach kids a bit more about computers, but that also includes making sure they understand the basics of the electronics that make up the hardware. A broadened technical subject in elementary school were kids get to build simple circuit boards, do a bit of soldering, get a taste for repairing stuff and on top of that maybe try some programming is what I think we need. It doesn't have to be much, it doesn't have to be several times a week for several years, it can be like once a week for one year. Primarily it should be inspiring and eye-opening.</p><p>I actually had a subject called "technology" in 8:th grade and we got to do the stuff above, except for programming. We soldered circuit boards that played music when connected to a 9 v battery, we learned how to change an AC-plug and some very basic electronics theory. However, few of my Swedish friends seem to have done this (so much for a standardized school system!), and it's sad because it was for me one of the most fun and inspiring parts of elementary school.</p><p>When I repair electronics, I'm often reminded of that component-filled room with the slightly weird teacher and people poking away with soldering irons.</p></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/neutralt_fummel.html'>January 15, 2017</a><h1>Neuralt fummel (Swedish)</h1><p></p><pre><p>Denna eviga förvirring.
Jag sitter var dag och funderar.
Vad är det som skall komma härnäst;
sorg, glädje, rädsla eller ilska?
Mina tankar blandas timme in och ut.
Hur det nu än blir så vet jag säkert,
att barndommens lätta sinne
i en evig neural storm har gömts.</p><p>Under promenaden in till staden,
i öronen det otäcka programmet.
Berättelser om vem som lever,
berättelser om vem som dör,
sorgen i att åt andra tvingas välja.
Medan tåget genom kylan lunka fram,
ett mörker över mig sakta sjunka.
Jag får hålla mig från att
i oförklarlig vrede och förvirring,
rakt ut i vagnen börja gasta.</p><p>Stopp. Tåget har rullat in på station,
ett annat jag måste finna.
I väntan jag står och uppmärksammar:
Ögon ögon ögon som stirrar överallt,
alla tankar, all historia,
som bor dessa i väderbitna personer.
Ögon möter mig och jag funderar om
min förvirrade blick de försöker tyda.</p><p>Tåget anländer, fötterna går ombord,
det är en underjordisk rälsbuss.
Medan den för mig mot yttre ort,
damen i gången läser en karta.
Underbart att inte veta vart man ska
tänker jag som vet vart, men inte varför,
jag far dit jag far.</p><p>Rälsen stannar, tåget går av.
Katakomberna sluter sig kring mig,
vilket utgång bör jag ta?
Jag går upp åt ett håll,
fast vänder ner igen.</p><p>Nu kom jag rätt, här har jag varit.
Fötterna går ner för gatan, ögonen ser huset.
Fummel fummel. Långsamma, kalla fingrar.
Siffra siffra siffra siffra. Klick.</p><p>Upp högst upp, men inte upp till vinden.
Jag ringer på, min vän öppnar och
med ett leende mig möter.</p><p>"Hur är läget?"
"Jo, det är väl helt okej."
</p></pre></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/i_just_want_to_be_free.html'>December  7, 2016</a><h1>I just want to be free</h1><p></p><p>I don't want to pile up money in order to pay a rent and have fancy things. Money is a prison. When you have enough you subscribe to this and that thing until you are locked into a cage from which you have little hope of escaping.</p><p>Ever since resigning from my most recent job in February I have had a growing feeling that I never want to work again. This is, in the modern world, a problem. My mere existence forces me to every month pay money to a handful corporations in order to stay afloat.</p><p>Right now I'm studying physics at university and I'm very happy about it. I have no real plans of what I'm going to do with whatever it is that I learn, but at least I get to do something interesting. Here there is no boss assessing whatever I do. There is no one that cares about what I do, and it's the best thing ever. Having someone judge your daily achievements is for me a horrible way to spend your days I hope I never have to experience it again.</p><p>Sometimes I hear friends saying "I just want to finish the education and get a job" and I freeze. The thought that I too, some day, must return to my old place in the big wheel, is frightening. I don't want to. Education in Sweden is free and I get a monthly free grant plus loan which will last for another three years. This is roughly the time it will take me to get my bachelor's degree in physics. What I'll do after that I do not know. What I'm gonna do this summer, in order to pay the rent the couple of summer months where I don't get the study grant, I do not know. I do not want to work. But I guess I can put up with like one month of work during the beginning of the summer, scraping together barley enough for the rest of the summer.</p><p>Maybe I'll find something that works for me at some point. Maybe by making indie games. Maybe I'll somehow fund a master's degree in aerospace engineering or physics. I'm not gonna try to plan these things, but I'm actively going to stay away from working tiring jobs that subtract from life quality more than they add.</p><p>I just want to be free.</p></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/on_creating_games_from_scratch.html'>February  7, 2016</a><h1>On writing games from scratch</h1><p></p><p>Lately I have been writing some quite grumpy posts on Twitter regarding third-party game engines, so I felt it was time to do a write-up on the topic.</p><p>Every now and then people find out that some game which has been released recently was written from scratch, meaning it did not use any third-party game engine. Whenever this is found out about I often start hearing comments from game devs and gamers like "yeah well that game didn't need to have it's own engine" or "the cost of making the game could probably have been reduced a lot if they went with something like Unity". Sure, if you are a game developer that likes using something like Unity, then fine, use that engine as long as you like it and you're happy developing using it. </p><p>It's important to note that by making your own engine, or <em>writing from scratch</em> as I prefer to call it, you usually do not mean making a general-purpose engine before you start making the game. In most cases it means creating a specific-purpose monolithic program where the "engine part" and game is just one big program, created in tandem.</p><p>Please note that I usually work in small to medium-sized teams. I do not work in large teams (AAA etc), therefore I have no strong opinions on how I'd like to make games in such teams. This text is not going to be some "there is one correct ultimate way to make games"-thing. It all boils down to what a game developer likes and what makes them happy.</p><h2>The joy of programming</h2><p>
I have been working for a while at a company where we use Unreal Engine 4 for our game. The game is looking great. I love the team. But I really don't enjoy the day-to-day work, all because of one thing: I do not find it fun to program in Unreal. And by "not finding it fun" I mean that actually typing the code and reasoning about how to transfer the problem in my head into lines of code just isn't fun.</p><p>There are some Unreal-specific and some non-Unreal-specific reasons for me feeling like this. I don't want to go into the details of the Unreal-specific reasons now, but let's say it's a combination of the following: Really really bad iteration times. Forcing you to use what I think is a bad sub-set of C++. The bad iteration times in combination with the bad sub-set of C++ makes you write more than you want in Unreal's visual scripting language Blueprint. Blueprint has pretty neat iteration times, but is near-impossible to refactor when shit hits the fan. I can literally count on my fingers the times I've found excitement and a general <em>joy of programming</em> while using Unreal.</p><p>All this lack of joy made me work slower. I think people underestimate how important the joy of programming is. I feel like I'm at 10% effectiveness whenever I'm unhappy writing code. Whenever I feel like I'm doing something slower than I can, I feel stressed. And when I feel like I do things slower than I can on daily basis, I get chronically stressed.</p><p>I've been working in Unreal for the whole summer and fall of 2015 and I really really tried to pull myself through it. I wanted to work on this great game with these great people. But it turned out to be the most stressful period of my life and I have not been feeling well because of it. Because of some piece of software. It may sound like I'm a spoiled kid for not having worse problems. Sure, I have had an otherwise very problem-free 2015. Any other big crisis would probably have overshadowed these problems. But still, it is what has been eating me, driving me nuts and stressing me out.</p><p>I'm simply put the wrong person to be working on a project using Unreal. My co-workers don't seem feel nearly as frustrated by Unreal and I'm glad that they are happy and continue working on our great game. But I have because of these issues resigned from my job. My last day will be February 29, 2016.</p><h2>What about other engines?</h2><p>
At this point someone probably thinks that if I was working on a project which used Unity I would have none of the above problems. Yes, Unity has neater iteration times. It does few of the weird things with the programming that Unreal does. It is substantially more fun to code using it. I have used Unity for lots of game jams and I find it great for such purposes.</p><p>However, this text is more about my feelings working on longer projects. In a long project that uses Unity I still feel substantially less joy than if I had written the game from scratch. All developers have different tastes in how to create. Just like Bob Ross paints everything using primarily two big brushes and a paint knife, all game developers have their own personal style when creating games. Some don't want to be concerned with what happens under the hood, only writing gameplay scripts on top an opaque engine. Others are driven by knowing what the computer is actually doing, ultimately having to craft most of the program themselves. I know I am the latter but I think both ways are fine and it is in choosing what suits you that you stay happy and less stressed.</p><h2>Changing stuff up</h2><p>
Ron Gilbert recently wrote a <a href="https://blog.thimbleweedpark.com/engine">blog entry</a> about engines on the Thimbleweed Park blog from which this quote comes: "I started to take a close look at engines that were suitable for a 2D point & click game. Lots of great choices, but deep down (if I'm honest with myself), I'm a game engine snob. Whenever I use an engine, I keep wanting to modify it and hack into it to do what I need. I guess I've found over the years that it's a lot easier (and less stressful) for me if I just create my own.". Something that really resonated with me was, for previously explained reasons, the "and less stressful" parenthesis, but also the part about modifying the engine to suit your needs.</p><p>Most complex third-party engines often need surgery. Some of them don't come with source, which is deal-breaker for me if I'm gonna do a longer project. But even if you manage to get source access you suddenly have a new set of problems. As you start hacking into the source and make your modifications you probably, unless it's late in the project, regularly update to newer versions of the engine. With enough modifications in your own version of the engine the merges with new versions get so time-consuming that you start restraining yourself from changing the engine in the first place.</p><p>You might also do engine surgery the Unreal-way where everything is super object-oriented and you create your own subclass of the vanilla engine class and completely override functions in the engine. But this is also a bad idea! Suddenly you're leaving dead code everywhere, making browsing through the engine source harder.</p><h2>It's just a program!</h2><p>
When I code I strive for making tidy and lean solutions that gets the job done. Using a general-purpose game engine kind of takes you in the opposite direction. You probably only use a portion of the features in the engine, making a big chunk of your game's collective code into bloat. All of the unused features are just noise there to distract you as you find your way through the engine code, looking for that thing you wanted to change. When I write from scratch I feel at ease because I think of all the code usually found in general-purpose engines that I <em>avoided</em> having in my game.</p><p>I firmly believe that a program should be as clear as possible and contain only the stuff it actually needs. And as I see it, a game is just a program! For me it makes sense to have a single monolithic program where engine and game code live in symbiosis. It's a program where I can throw out whatever code I feel without remorse. It's a program where I know that most of the code is used. It's a program where I have a chance to understand how everything works. And most importantly, it's a program that was fun to create.</p></div><div class='index_nav_buttons'><a class="prev_button" href="index_3.html">Newer posts</a></div><div style='clear:both'></div>
