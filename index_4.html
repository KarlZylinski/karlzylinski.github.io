His clothes consisted of a tracksuit, and the blond hair was in a bun on the top back of his head, as was fashionable at the time.</p><p>His steps were casual. He was eating a banana. When the banana was almost consumed, maybe having 1/3 left of it's fruity innards, he saw someone approach him down the street. The person approaching was to him unknown, and he held IKEA-bags. The bags were presumably filled with clothes, as revealed by him heading for the small house in which laundry was done.</p><p>The person with the bun, tracksuit and banana froze in his walk. The laundry man looked up, confused. As if entering a battle stance the frozen man aggressively threw his almost eaten banana in the ground and produced, maybe hidden in his other hand, maybe from his pockets, two small wooden sticks. The stick were about 20 centimeters long, maybe 2 centimeters in diameter and were covered with really beautiful carvings.</p><p>While in this battle stance, with the laundry man by now looking slightly afraid, he began hitting the sticks together, over his head, playing a kind of catchy rhythm "tock tock tocktock, tock tock tocktock, tock tock tocktock". Holding his legs stiff and shuffling around, he moved around like a monkey hitting two interesting items together in the hopes of scaring something away (or something, I don't know anything about monkeys!).</p><p>By now the laundry man found the whole situation slightly uncomfortable. He did not seem to know or recall ever meeting this track-suited loony. The door to the laundry was closer to him, and he went towards it, going out of sight from the other. The man with the sticks immediately stopped playing. But before being able to enter the laundry house, the man with the sticks had rounded the corner of the building, seen the man again and jumped straight into the same pose and played his melody until the other disappeared into the laundry house with his IKEA-bags.</p><p>The man in the tracksuit was later seen standing still on a lawn, checking his phone, during a hail storm.</p><p><em>The situation above was seen from my bedroom window</em></p></div></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/a_really_secure_bed_in_the_darkness.html'>May  3, 2017</a><div class="post"><h1>A really secure bed in the darkness</h1><p></p><p>Late at night. I really have to sleep. There are things to do tomorrow, I don't have time to be awake.</p><p>Yet it is during these hours that the world and all solutions to our problems seem so simple. Sometimes, when trying to sleep, a thought train leaves the station of my mind and slowly I start thinking of all my problems.</p><p>During these hours, the problems, they have obvious solutions. Especially the really personal problems. That thing I always wanted to discuss with him, it seemed so simple, I felt like I could just do it. I would get it over with. That awkward way in which I speak whenever I feel insecure, the fix was dead simple. I would just walk into situations and say the straight thing and be dead sure about it. I feel that tomorrow will be the dawn of the really secure me. Those problems with emotions that I don't know how to convey, those would be said out loud. There, in the security of my bed, there, in the darkness, I'm not afraid of doing so.</p><p>Dawn comes. I charge into the new day, tired from lack of sleep from the night before, but I still believe. But then the day slowly wears me down. I get into an insecure situation and I'm even more awkward than the day before. Feelings of anxiety strike me if I try to figure how how to approach him. The emotions I fail to convey are even more shrouded than before.</p><p>This was typed from the security of my bed, in the darkness. The time is 01:56. I feel very sure about these words, but I'm sure tomorrow has something else in store.</p></div></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/habits_hands_bamse.html'>May  2, 2017</a><div class="post"><h1>Habits, hands, Bamse</h1><p></p><p>It's often said that it takes a couple of weeks to create a new habit or destroy an old one. This is often pointed out as some kind of self-help-thumb-rule. However, imagine jumping straight out of bed, standing on one hand for a minute while singing the theme music for Swedish kids-television-show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jePUt1FIiUE">Bamse</a>. Now imagine doing this every day for ten years. After these ten years, it would very hard to stop doing this, even though it's the dumbest and weirdest shit ever.</p></div></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/on_programming_in_elementary_school.html'>May  2, 2017</a><div class="post"><h1>On programming in elementary school</h1><p></p><p>There has been some ideas floating around on Twitter and news sites the past years that it would be a good idea to teach kids how to program computers in elementary school. The motivation for this is is that we live in a world surrounded by technical gadgets and that a deeper understanding for these things could improve our everyday life.</p><p>While I support this idea, I think some people take it a bit too far, without looking at the big picture. Some make is sound like programming should be a big subject next to other, more universal things like language, history and maths. This I do not agree with. Programming is just one part of the tech that surrounds us, but it's easy to forget that there is actually hardware in these things, circuits that have been meticulously designed in order for the software to even have something to run on. There are also other things involved, such as the AC-power leading up to your house, and how that electricity is produced.</p><p>What I'm trying to get at is that, yes we should probably teach kids a bit more about computers, but that also includes making sure they understand the basics of the electronics that make up the hardware. A broadened technical subject in elementary school were kids get to build simple circuit boards, do a bit of soldering, get a taste for repairing stuff and on top of that maybe try some programming is what I think we need. It doesn't have to be much, it doesn't have to be several times a week for several years, it can be like once a week for one year. Primarily it should be inspiring and eye-opening.</p><p>I actually had a subject called "technology" in 8:th grade and we got to do the stuff above, except for programming. We soldered circuit boards that played music when connected to a 9 v battery, we learned how to change an AC-plug and some very basic electronics theory. However, few of my Swedish friends seem to have done this (so much for a standardized school system!), and it's sad because it was for me one of the most fun and inspiring parts of elementary school.</p><p>When I repair electronics, I'm often reminded of that component-filled room with the slightly weird teacher and people poking away with soldering irons.</p></div></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/neutralt_fummel.html'>January 15, 2017</a><div class="post"><h1>Neuralt fummel (Swedish)</h1><p></p><pre><p>Denna eviga förvirring.
Jag sitter var dag och funderar.
Vad är det som skall komma härnäst;
sorg, glädje, rädsla eller ilska?
Mina tankar blandas timme in och ut.
Hur det nu än blir så vet jag säkert,
att barndommens lätta sinne
i en evig neural storm har gömts.</p><p>Under promenaden in till staden,
i öronen det otäcka programmet.
Berättelser om vem som lever,
berättelser om vem som dör,
sorgen i att åt andra tvingas välja.
Medan tåget genom kylan lunka fram,
ett mörker över mig sakta sjunka.
Jag får hålla mig från att
i oförklarlig vrede och förvirring,
rakt ut i vagnen börja gasta.</p><p>Stopp. Tåget har rullat in på station,
ett annat jag måste finna.
I väntan jag står och uppmärksammar:
Ögon ögon ögon som stirrar överallt,
alla tankar, all historia,
som bor dessa i väderbitna personer.
Ögon möter mig och jag funderar om
min förvirrade blick de försöker tyda.</p><p>Tåget anländer, fötterna går ombord,
det är en underjordisk rälsbuss.
Medan den för mig mot yttre ort,
damen i gången läser en karta.
Underbart att inte veta vart man ska
tänker jag som vet vart, men inte varför,
jag far dit jag far.</p><p>Rälsen stannar, tåget går av.
Katakomberna sluter sig kring mig,
vilket utgång bör jag ta?
Jag går upp åt ett håll,
fast vänder ner igen.</p><p>Nu kom jag rätt, här har jag varit.
Fötterna går ner för gatan, ögonen ser huset.
Fummel fummel. Långsamma, kalla fingrar.
Siffra siffra siffra siffra. Klick.</p><p>Upp högst upp, men inte upp till vinden.
Jag ringer på, min vän öppnar och
med ett leende mig möter.</p><p>"Hur är läget?"
"Jo, det är väl helt okej."
