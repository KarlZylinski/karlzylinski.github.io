the need to share words with a friend.
Long past dusk, but the path still visible,
a thermos my only luggage.</p><p>Across the stream a bridge was built.
Rocks thereunder suffice as chair.
The trees are green, my shoes are red,
shrouded in darkness all around me
these colors live their nightly life.</p><p>I brought no companion,
only this hot beverage
and my thoughts.</p><p>Minutes turn into an hour.
A mug a mug a mug.
Earl's reserves are low.</p><p>They'll never catch the wacko
sitting by the stream
alone at night
drinking tea
pondering life.

The sky was dark, purple and a heavy yellow moon hung high above. At first everything was quiet, but gradually the wind began picking up speed until it howled and the light drizzle turned into rain that whipped and whipped against his skin. Lightning struck, many bolts, coming closer. He was getting very cold, shivering.</p><p>A deafening sound, a blinding light and all around him the trees exploded into fire. "WHERE AM I?" he screamed, terrified. Lightning struck again and again. Eventually it formed a standing wall of vertical bolts, shaped like a circle, in which he was trapped. The electric and fiery light shone like flickering floodlights.</p><p>In this beyond surreal world he sat down on his knees, whimpering. From outside the wall of flames and bolts a hand reached out to him, as if it wanted him to grab it. He hesitated, and then went for it. He grabbed and pulled. The body to which the hand was attached flew towards him, midair the head looked up. It was badly scorched. No hair, the skin cracked and dry. He sat huddled in the middle of this electric inferno, screaming in horror, looking at the body of his long-gone friend.</p></div></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/sleeping_is_hard.html'>May 17, 2017</a><div class="post"><h1>Sleeping is hard</h1><p></p><p>There is something truly annoying about having lots of things to do, going to bed and then finding yourself wide awake, hoping that it'll be morning soon so you can do those things. After lying there for three hours and coming to the conclusion that your sleeping isn't going so well you think "well maybe I should go up and do that thing!" but now you've been in bed for so long that it would be ludicrous to do so! You might fall asleep at any moment. Now you become irritated that you wasted all these hours lying in bed, not sleeping when you could have done that thing. Now you're just upset instead, sleep becoming even harder to achieve. About an hour after this you fall asleep and you wake up at shit o'clock.</p><p>Annoying, isn't it?</p></div></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/the_threshold_of_calm.html'>May  9, 2017</a><div class="post"><h1>The threshold of calm</h1><p></p><p>I like taking walks, for many reasons. Maybe I was fed up with whatever I was doing, maybe I needed some air.</p><p>Sometimes I take walks because it feels like there's something heavy inside my chest, a kind of unrest. At those moments I try taking really deep breaths, because it feels like it might help. It feels like the depth of my breaths—how filled my lungs get—have a threshold. It feels like if a single breath was to get past that threshold, the heavy feeling would subside.</p><p>So it's not unusual for me to find myself walking around, breathing deeply, focused, hunting for that threshold. If I'm unlucky, the heaviness stays. But in a few cases, after walking around outside for a couple of minutes, I successfully inhale so deeply that the threshold is overwon and during the following exhale I feel a big, fuzzy calm take hold of me.</p><p>I like those moments.</p></div></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/a_short_life_and_a_pile_of_papers.html'>May  7, 2017</a><div class="post"><h1>A short life and a pile of papers</h1><p></p><p>I have pages upon pages of short stories, lyrics, thoughts and feelings written down. On pieces of papers scattered throughout my bedroom. On my computers.</p><p>Throughout my twenties I have attempted a lot of hobbies. I recently realized that the only one—except fiddling around with computers and playing guitar—that has stuck around is writing. It comes to me naturally to just start typing or writing whenever I feel empty inside or when something huge wants to come out.</p><p>This realization made me think that it's probably better for me to focus on the hobbies that come naturally by having the tools around to do them. If it's painting or drawing, I'll have those tools around me. If it's playing music, I'll have my instruments at hand. I'll surround myself with the stuff I need in order to spontaneously do the things I might like.</p><p>If I surround myself with these things without anything happening, I will not attempt to force it anymore. Life is too short for that.</p></div></div><div class='index_nav_buttons'><a class="prev_button" href="index_2.html">Newer posts</a><a class="next_button" href="index_4.html">Older posts</a></div><div style='clear:both'></div>
