<p>Random stuff I've written.</p>

<h2>Teleportation</h2>
<p>Imagine that you have a teleportation device that operates by molecular deconstruction. It is able to teleport a whole human by deconstructing all the molecules in the body, sending the information to a remote location and then having it perfectly reconstructed. Imagine that this device teleports you instantly, while you are conscious. This should in theory perfectly transport your consciousness along with the body. The human emerging on the other side will know exactly what just happened, all memories retained.</p>

<p>But what is it that really happens as you are deconstructed and the blueprint of your body is sent to the other end? By biological definition you die. Tearing the body apart in order to figure out how it is assembled must surely count as dying. Still, the person emerging on the other side is all you, flesh and mind. This brings us to the question, what is really the consciousness? Is there really a one consciousness? If you loose consciousness by just falling asleep, then one might argue that this actually kills you in the same way that our teleportation device does. And if we know this, then why are we at all afraid of dying, when we seem to do it every night?</p>

<p>The answer might lie in our definition of death. Since we know that we always emerge from sleep with body and mind intact, we do not perceive it as death. Even though we have no idea if our mind is just a copy of yesterdays or the real deal. Seeing this as death and being afraid of it would be seen as silly, it is part of our biological nature and there is nothing to do about it.</p>

<p>Going back to our teleportation device, imagine that you are about to be teleported against your will. You have been told that this will kill you, but that a perfect copy of you and your conscious mind will emerge on the other side. Even with the latter part of what we were told, most people would probably be very afraid. Many would probably experience the same kind of fear that someone who is about to be executed might feel. Then, as you are deconstructed at the height of your greatest fear, you die. And at the other end, a person scared senseless emerges, knowing that the original she or he just died.</p>

<p>But yet there they are, flesh and mind. Wide awake from the yesterday's sleep.
