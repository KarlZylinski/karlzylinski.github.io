These days I barley listen to music. I used to have my headphones on at all times outside, there was always some album that was the &quot;current&quot; one, looping. Now all that surrounds me is silence, and I enjoy it. Walks, several hour long walks, in silence. No, not silence, there is some kind of noise, in my head, but that is just me pondering. The thoughts can be classified into two categories. The first one is idle chatter, like small talk, I might run through things, plans, situations – nothing of big importance. I often make up music, there is often a &quot;song of the day&quot;; some loop that was made up somewhere in there, I found it appealing, it keeps repeating. Funny, I don&#x27;t listen to music, so I sub-consciously make music. Anyways, this category is the &quot;I don&#x27;t have a lot on my mind&quot;. It is sort of a relaxed state. Sometimes I don&#x27;t think about anything at all. Sometimes I try to not think of anything at all, most of above is after all just nonsense. Except the music bit, I think allowing yourself to make up small tunes is good. Why, I do not know. I come up with such a multitude of little songs (not that I record them in any way, some stick for a long time, but almost all of them disappear in due time) that I have been thinking &quot;oh my, maybe I should focus my time on being a musician&quot;. Stuff just seems to fall out without effort from somewhere deep within me. Perhaps that is how you should choose what to do in life. Just sit still, don&#x27;t do anything. See what comes out spontaneously and refine that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the other category of brain-noise is more like some sort of serious debate. You know, whatever happens when you have problems and your brain goes back and forth about it. I have this little habit, which I know at least one other friend also has, to make almost a &quot;play&quot; in my head. You know, like a stage play. It is usually when the whatever is bothering or consuming me includes a real person. I simulate the conversation I know I will have or want to have. Often it can be helpful, but sometimes I guess it&#x27;s a bit harmful because I build this idea of how people are going to respond and when I actually have the real conversation nothing is every really like I thought. It always starts out completely different than I imagined and then people don&#x27;t react like I thought. But ah, whatever, I think I do this less often now. Most of my &quot;play&quot; conversation are instead about important topics that I want to discuss, sometimes I just seem to have a discussion with some arbitrary, shapeless person. It&#x27;s not a preparation for a specific conversation, I just try to make my thoughts cohesive. I think this version of these little plays are good, because everything becomes untangled and I can express ideas clearly at later points. Oh well, yeah, the make-believe-conversion-with-friend is probably not 100% good, but I have started dispelling them with this mantra: &quot;except for things that are set in stone, nothing will ever turn out like expected&quot;. I think it&#x27;s neat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I have been thinking about is what we humans do to ourselves and our planet and how it will end and all that. It has been said that in order to make the required changes to stop climate change, we would need to put society into a state of war-like rationing. Especially in countries like Sweden. My mother is a teacher for 7-9 graders and she asked them what impact they think swedes have on the environment. There was this green-politics-active student who thought we were so good because we recycle and buy organic stuff and whatnot. But turns out that we are among the worst. Well, good that we recycle, but why do we have so much to recycle in the first place? Even with trends of second-hand shopping and all that, we are still insane over-consumers. Swedes consume like we have slightly more than 4 planets to spare. So something radical has to be done about that! It must be the first stop of all green political efforts. A radical shift away from consumerism. People at the top needs to stand up and say &quot;hey, it&#x27;s ok to live a basic life. We don&#x27;t need to have all these things. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to have the good, happy life while not consuming so much.&quot; But they don&#x27;t. Even the most green of political parties in Sweden seem to be caught up in introducing policies that will slightly shift behaviors in some desired direction. But it is not enough. I don&#x27;t get how they are able to look themselves in the mirror and call themselves the green party. With the challenges of today, being green MUST mean that you are radically anti-consumerist and it must become an ok idea to broadcast to the public. Looking at what these politicians want to do, if they got their own majority, is laughable. Even if we did everything that the Swedish green party wanted we would still need 2 planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing about these parties – be it the green party or the left party (which are supposed to be &quot;as green&quot;) – is the incompatibility of the green ideas and their economy politics. Like I said, they need to be radical anti-consumerists and they need to be it yesterday. But these are parties that are bound up in the normal capitalist economy. If we were to be more radically anti-consumerist, then we would have to have a negative economic growth, the whole developed world needs to. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. If we want to move from requiring 4 planets to less than 1, then humongous changes need to be put in place. This is the state of war-like rationing I mentioned. But since we are so used to having everything, being able to &quot;be free&quot; by spending money on whatever we want, it would be very hard to introduce any such system. There might even break out civil war. Or something. Bad stuff would happen. All this because we THINK that we are free, the feeling of freedom coming from the fact that we know that we can use our money to buy stuff, go anywhere. But we are bound up, like slaves. We have been tricked into having to work long hours to pay for lots of stuff we don&#x27;t need in order to destroy the only thing we do need, our home. Because of this, because we are like insane addicts who would go rampage if anything drastically changed and because this drastic change needs to happen I am fairly sure society as we know it is fucked. We who are young today are likely to see the fall of modern civilization. I don&#x27;t think everyones gonna die or anything, but lots will. There will be refugees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is really just a manifestation of a more general thing, that radical change cannot happen without there being a vacuum. The world is like that. New types of government cannot be tested without a power vacuum. I like giving the example of Rojava in northern Syria, an autonomous region where they have flipped the pyramid of power in society upside down, utilizing what I think is best described as anarchism-with-a-framework. Something similar will happen with the world with regards to climate change. As the whole planet goes into a state of emergence and state after state breaks into pieces, people will look back and see how they were tricked into working far more than they needed so that they could buy things they didn&#x27;t need in order to destroy the planet they needed. There will be new societies, doing right what we did not, but the road there will be filled with incomprehensible suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will now start the last semester of my bachelor in physics and astronomy. I often joke that I completely switch direction in life every third year. Up until a couple of months ago, I was fairly sure that I would stay on the physics track, even get a master degree in astronomy. But thing is, I have recently begun to doubt the whole point of it all. I have learned a lot and it has given me fantastic insight and I have even noticed positive effects in other parts of life. For example, my problem-solving abilities have improved dramatically. I sat down and did some 3D programming last year and complex things like 3D collision detection and collision solving was actually pretty doable, because I was able to methodically break it down in a nice way. I felt like I was able to quickly solve complicated and sticky problems while also having fun, where I would previously have been mostly upset. Anyways, I haven&#x27;t completely decided on what to do. If I do continue with the 2-year-master then I will probably go to Edinburgh for my first year (unless Brexit fucks everything up). The primary reason for going isn&#x27;t that I think I will learn more astronomy that way (I think I would be able to be more focused and organized if I didn&#x27;t go), it is simply that I would like to live in an English-speaking community for an extended period of time, I think that will give my English skills that extra flare that I can achieve in Swedish, both written and spoken. The reason I might not continue is simply that I probably don&#x27;t want to work in the field, I study it mostly out of curiosity. Also, I have been thinking about how I actually would want to go about life outside of university. My thinking is like this. People are to isolated nowadays. We do not help each other like we ought to. Help can&#x27;t be free, if I were to go out there and just try to help people they might even find it suspicious that someone would like to help just like that. If you want help, then you pay someone to do it. We have stopped talking to each other, creating an economic bubble around us and we interact with the unknown world using our wallets. We are truly more lonely and isolated than ever. I don&#x27;t want that. I am seriously thinking about living someplace cheap, working a few days a week and then just trying to organize myself in helping those that need it most. It seems like the antidote I think the world needs. I much rather to this than going back to working full-time and trying to do meaningful things in between.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ketsket (Swedish)</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/ketsket.html</link><pubDate>29 May 2018</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ett knippe strålar målar genom dansande damm en vägg rödspräcklig. På sängen en någon, ett något. En varelse, en person?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mot sängkanten, bort från väggen rullade Den; fötter lades på golvet. Släpande fötter släpade sig bort mot gläntade dörr, det dansande dammets ljuskällor skymdes tillfälligt under passagen. Utanför dörren hände en korridor och stegen närmade sig ett pentry. Vatten hettades i gammal bucklig el-manick, troligen hemmabygge, troligen resterande ting i huset likaså. Väggen över el-manicken var täckt av spikar spikar spikar, livlina åt ett myller av köksattiraljer, en av dem en mugg. Muggen var nu på träbänken – den träbänk som tycktes växa fram ur väggen eftersom den var nära besläktad med såväl väggar som golv som tak. Tebladen kastades i muggen utan att omslutas av vare sig kula eller påse, vatten av godtycklig varmhet hälldes över.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fötterna, aningen mindre släpande, släpstegade sig bort mot korridorens kortsida och dess dörr. Dra handtaget inåt och uppåt, ett reflexmässigt knyck. In flödade ljus, ut flödade Den. Hit, till balkongen, rann solens röda strålar obehindrat. Muggen placerades på litet bord intill enkel stol, på vilken Den nu satt. Den, bordet och stolen omslöts av ett räcke som då och då avbröts av träpelare. Dessa pelare hade som uppdrag att hålla taket uppe – det tak som hängde över balkongen för att skydda mot det regn som aldrig föll från den himmel som aldrig sett ett moln.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopp på bord, kropp på stol. Ögonen vandrade över räcket och föll långt långt ned till det blågröna gräset som dansade sin kontinuerliga dans. Havslikt flödade vågor av ständig bris över meterhöga strån. Den sippade på teet; agerade munsil. Bittert, ja. Vinden vände och blicken började surfa, släpades ut till havs av gräsvågor som lämnade hemmet. Bort bort bortåt, mot kanten på alltet. Fixerad på krusningarna kändes det som om hela huset rörde på sig. Än dög den. Än dög synen av hur balkongräckets bruna, kråkslottiga form bröts av mot det blågröna vaggande gräshavet som sträckte sig hela vägen bort till det horisontella gränssnitt där hav övergick i röd, arg himmel, vars ilska kulminerade i den rosenrasande solen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surfandet fortskred tills teet var slut och muggen tillbaka på sin hemspik. Promenaden nedåt inleddes. Våning efter våning, ned ned ned. På många våningar rummen knappt klara – en stackare hade oturen att sakna en hel vägg, fick nöja sig med bärande pelare. Ned ned ned, timmar passerade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Framme, bottenvåning. Här bodde någon förr, men inte nu. Beviset ännu ett pentry samt en före detta säng; sned, trasig och ledsen. Ytterdörr fanns på plats – men Den gick inte dit, utan sökte sig till ännu en trappa. Nedåtgående trappor leder från en bottenvåning under botten: en källare fuktig och sval. Här nere fanns en öppning i underjorden som ledde till en tunnel där stödbjälkar gruvschaktslikt höll jorden kvar. Den tände ögonen och försvann in i mörkret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tunneln smal, låg i tak och tilläts inte hålla på länge innan en sväng avbröt och tog Den in i ett mindre bergrum. Hål i tak gjorde rummet skumt rödbelyst och tillhandahöll ett rep som rakt ner hängde. Likt kristallstrukturer reste de sig ur tak, ur väggar och ur golv, hopande likt blombuketter. Vissa flera meter i höjd, andra bara stumpar. På en bukett fanns såväl plank som balk, ett i synnerhet varierat exemplar. Den stod framför denna fina samling, lade huvudet bestämt på sned varpå det första trästycket föll – en halvmeter lång planka, kapad från roten. Skörden blev ett tjugotal korta plankor och två långa balkar, runt vilka repet från ovan knöts. Den gick ut genom tunnel, upp ur källare, ut genom rosa ytterdörr och fann vid kanten av blågrön havsäng ett hål med tillhörande rep. Lasten drogs upp, hamnade framför huset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stående vid trähög tilläts blicken promenera upp för huset. De första våningarna hela och raka, skapta med omsorg. Därefter en tilltagande vårdslöshet; de korrekt dragna linjerna knycklades till, våningarna snabbt hopslagda, prydda av halvfärdiga väggar och vinda knutar. Den backade och lät blicken fortsätta uppåt uppåt uppåt. Det makalösa bygget reste sig, våningar staplade på varandra – vissa större än de under, vissa mindre. Det blågröna havet prasslade. Den varma brisen fläktade. Den rosenrasande solen lyste, fastspikad. Den lyste på hus och hav, men också på en kamrat. En kall kamrat som hängde högt ovan och kände sig utpekad av den mest osannolika skyskrapa ingen någonsin skådat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virkeshögens viloplats var i själva verket en plattform som var kopplad till en kätting som i sin tur försvann upp i oändligheten. Stående på plattformen intill virket grep Den med en precis rörelse tag i kättingen. Ögonen drog ihop sig, handen knöts hårt, som om djup koncentration behövde infinna sig. Lika oväntat som verkligheten accelererade plattformen uppåt. På bara några sekunder var marken därunder ett myller av blågrönt där separata grässtrån inte längre gick att urskilja. Luftmotståndet sade sitt; ett oerhört susande och vinande. Upp upp upp, våning våning våning susade förbi, nästan som om Den föll uppåt. Långt där nere började den tidigare platta världen förvridas, horisonten sjönk som om någon dragit ur badkarets propp, randen mellan gräshav och upprörd himmel drog ihop sig till en cirkel, till en sfär. Timmar hade passerat då Den och lasten med en försiktig inbromsning anlände till översta våning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;På toppen av denna spik, som växte ur den nu knytnävsstora bollen, fanns ännu ett ofärdigt rum. Men Den ämnade inte att färdigställa det. Istället lyftes blicken uppåt. Precis ovanför hängde ett grått tak: solens kalla kamrat. Från markplan hade världen tyckts platt och kamraten sfärisk. De hade nu bytt roller och Den såg kamrattakets yta sträcka sig bort mot ofantligheten – en inverterad horisont. Solen fick takets märkliga, grå material att skimra likt en sjö.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Det trä som hade följt med upp fördelades på golvet. Två långa balkar parallellt med korta plankor tvärs över, jämna mellanrum. Blicken fästes på en av mötespunkterna mellan plank och balk och de smalt omedelbart samman. Proceduren upprepades tills den cirka fyra meter långa stegen var färdig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fastkilad i ett av golvets jack restes stegen; dess topp slog emot en grå bumling på kamratens yta och Den var precis i färd med att ta det första klivet då benen hejdade sig. Ivriga steg stegade istället ned för trappan till våningen under. Några dagar senare kom Den tillbaka, bärande på stolen som inte längre stod på balkongen. Stol under arm, fot på nedersta steg; det första klivet upp, och det andra och det tredje... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nu, nära nog takets yta för Den att vidröra om så villes, ställdes stolen upp i taket. Den stod kvar. Ett tak utan bjälkar är ett golv. Tvekets korta stund följdes av trevande hand, sträckte sig uppåt. Fingerspetsens vidrödande utav kamratens kalla yta fick världen att vända. Den störtade med armarna först mot taket som var golvet som var kamraten. Oskadd reste Den sig, nu med fötter på det hårda, dammiga underlaget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stolen justerades så den stod precis under – ovan? – ovanunder rummet Den just hade lämnat. Den satte sig i stolen, lät blicken färdas ett varv. Runtom stod det grå landskapet öde. Rakt framför skickade solen ut sina rosenrasande strålar, gjorde vistelsen behaglig. Ovanför, långt där uppe, hängde en liten blågrön sfär ur vilken en kil av trä reste sig mot pannan. Blicken återvände mot solen och Den blev på stolen för evigt sittandes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Generating static web pages</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/generating_static_webpages.html</link><pubDate>09 Apr 2018</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just finished updating this site a bit, making blog posts appear on the index page, generally making it more &quot;bloggy&quot;. When I made the site I knew I did not want any comments section on the blog, so I figured I might as well generate the whole thing offline! This approach is quite minimalistic and requires little server-side infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generating is done using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl-zylinski.github.io/blob/master/build.py&quot;&gt;this Python script&lt;/a&gt;. It takes &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl-zylinski.github.io/blob/master/template.html&quot;&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; in which it finds where to inject the header and content. After that it scans &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl-zylinski.github.io/tree/master/content&quot;&gt;this folder&lt;/a&gt; for .html-files from which the non-blog-post pages are generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generating of blog posts is hard-wired to look inside the folder &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl-zylinski.github.io/tree/master/content/posts&quot;&gt;content/posts&lt;/a&gt;. Every file in there is then parsed, translating the minimalistic markup to HTML. So in order to make a blog post I just add a file to the content/posts folder, run the python script and upload the result to my server (which currently happens to be GitHub pages, since they freely serve static sites). The generation of blog posts also spits out the Archive page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One funky thing I added was support for LaTeX markup (via KaTeX). This makes it possible to have fancy maths in the posts, making stuff such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://zylinski.se/post/everything_binomial.html&quot;&gt;this post about everything binomial&lt;/a&gt; possible. One thing I should do, but haven&#x27;t, is to run the LaTeX generation offline as well, currently it is done using Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this setup has been very nice and it has opened my eyes to how often we overuse complicated dynamic websites and all the associated infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Saturday</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/saturday.html</link><pubDate>09 Dec 2017</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whining noise, modulating.

Maybe I should get up. What was that? Dream? Yes. Good, didn&#x27;t like the face. Face? Was there a what time is it? Watch, next to pillow or maybe table-able? Able-table there-it-is fourteen thirty. Saturday, is okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, hah, got up! First try no snooze, you snooze you lose! Neck, less pain, but not good. Should maybe go for a run later on, running compacts the back or straightens you out or maybe it&#x27;s just good somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea, mmm, yes make tea. Oh right gotta fill the form, stupid experiment. Got up? 14:30. Ate breakfast? Yes, or, will do. Wait, is it breakfast at fourteen thirty? Mark it x withaquestionmarkyes. Good. No bedtime, bedtime is later. Not a time traveler. Time betrays us all, but I&#x27;m a time traveler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the hell dish mountain, an ocean. No-smell-fix-later. Tea is needed. Earl grey? Cinnamon? Cup? Small pot? Pot small pot where is pot oh I cleaned it&amp;mdash;not friends with the mountain, good. Fill up to one liter, no what, half a liter! Small pot. Ninety degrees, not hundred, so warm, can never drink. Think there&#x27;s no measuring spoo- nope empty, this teaspoon will do. Teaspoon! Made for tea. But when you use different tea spoons everyday you don&#x27;t get two point five teaspoons. All different, not tea. Standard, bah. Earl grey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did shitnothing yesterday must do shitsomething today. Fourieranalysis, no, optics, waves and optics. Okay. Haha giant coaster for pans for pot. From yesterdays computerdinner. Head not crammed. Was crammed yesterday, tried to read, loopback, nothing. Went to bed, better now? Now. The treatment of light as wave motion allows read yesterday, might as well re-read, brain unfried wavelength is considered to be negligible compared with the dimensions of oh it&#x27;s the limit. What time fourteen fifty twitter NO! Looking crams head. Wrote silly shit yesterday, looking will make me crammed, potato. Over here, far away on piano. Oh, tea!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the wavelength of light&amp;mdash;around 500 nm&amp;mdash;is very small compared to ordinary objects, not good, not going so well. Well no hah it&#x27;ll be okay. Wait. No. Recall that the appearance of distinct shadows influenced Newton to assert that the apparent back pains are no neck, not much back. Should really run later, compact it all, give it a good beat. Maybe later. Soon dark, who cares, cities have light. Is there snow? Shitty soon brokenagain blinders no snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a ray of light is reflected in peanuts. Breakfast. I marked it x withaquestiomark. Hi mountain! It&#x27;s friends with the toaster. Should turn the slices midway to make top crispy butwhocares. Tea? I just had tea. Water is good. Here&#x27;s the peanut butter, last peanut butter. One kilogram of peanut butter with start at Sunday, end at Saturday. One kilogram in a week, that&#x27;s something. Nice outside, good for running. Oh toast, next toast. Down, gonna eat four.

When does one automatically start breathing heavily? Just start now. Four steps in, four out. Or should it be two-two?

I don&#x27;t want much in the ways of luxury, but it would for example be nice to travel a bit more. But that would require money. I hate money. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if I had an easy enough way to just get hold of lots of money I wouldn&#x27;t mind. But I hate money because in order to get it you have to work. Working is a fantastic way to throw away your life. Spend your time. Spend your physical health. Spend your mental health. Spend all these precious unreplenishable resources, not even doing something you really like, committing to someone else&#x27;s bidding. All this, so you can get hold of that cash in order to do that thing than from the get-go was an extravagant luxury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because in the end you&#x27;ll land on minus. Oh hardy har har lets work 40 hours a week, feel like dying, so we can—in the short annual time slot where we are &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt;—go to Peru and see some shit. Some shit that would have been nice to see had we not been wasted from actually getting hold of that money which allowed us to go there. Ho ho ho lets continue! Let us do this thing until we&#x27;re 65 and retire so we can finally live life as old people, instead of having some kind of freedom, peace and calm in our prime years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a wasted life and I&#x27;d rather shoot myself than force myself through it. I will instead do whatever minimal effort I need to get money for rent and food and in my precious spare time do things I find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Daggmask (Swedish)</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/daggmask.html</link><pubDate>12 Jul 2017</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Från ytterdörrens utsida hörs ljudet av skor mot trappen av trä.

Hon är inte inom synhåll, men stegen hörs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jag har tappat masken.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ska hon fiska? Det är betet som saknas. Men hon fiskar inte.

Something that lasts longer that a fleeting thought, that occupies your mind, that is with you for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine trying to read a book. If you&#x27;re in a state of sadness, it might very hard to progress without dark thoughts popping in, disturbing you. This is probably the least surprising part of all this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine being in a state of happiness. You just can&#x27;t clear that happy feeling, a feeling which is connected to something that has happened in your life. Maybe an event occurred, an event that aligned with some deeply rooted expectations. This made you very happy, and the feeling has conquered your whole being. Try reading a book in this state. It might be just as hard as in the sad state! You want to pace around, giggle, tell your friends about the happy thing, etc. You can&#x27;t get anything done. Happiness is just another distraction, often created by the chance event that the coin toss that is life aligned with your expectations. The times when it doesn&#x27;t align, you end up in sadness instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, expectations cause happiness and sadness and I find that both are just a disturbance. So I grip the problem by the root and do away with expectations. When that is done, what state should I strive for? I strive for &lt;em&gt;emptiness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what do I refer to by emptiness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; refer to the feeling people have when they say &quot;I feel empty inside&quot;. I think that what people actually mean when they say that they &quot;feel empty inside&quot; is that their mind is so saturated by impressions that they feel exhausted. This bad feeling can come to me when I have too much to do, or when a terrible social gathering has taken all the juice out of me. Often when people &quot;feel empty inside&quot;, they try to push themselves, thinking they should be able to do something productive because they have an internal &quot;emptiness&quot;. They try to &lt;em&gt;fill it&lt;/em&gt;! But I think that people, whenever they feel like this, are actually completely saturated with impressions and should probably lie down on a couch and have tea for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, what I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; refer to by emptiness is the feeling of neither happiness or sadness. It&#x27;s a completely empty head, like a blank canvas. There are very few thoughts randomly attacking your mind. You are at peace. Try reading a book in this state. It&#x27;ll be like disappearing into the text. As long as there are no linguistic or logical hiccups in whatever you&#x27;re reading, it will be like intuitive understanding of someone else&#x27;s thoughts, put onto a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I prefer happiness over sadness, I put emptiness on a pedestal high above both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the above is true for &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; activities in my life. I am after all a book-consuming student. An empty mind vastly improves almost everything I do. Now, there are of course exceptions. Sometimes euphoria is a very wanted thing, sometimes even sadness is sought, but the activities connected to those states are probably exceptions to my daily habits. The things I do every day is what I find interesting in life, and none of that improves by going into them with a mind bothered by other thoughts, be they happy, sad or of some other nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Flight</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/flight.html</link><pubDate>19 Jun 2017</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the empty darkness – no room, no walls, no sky, no stars – time did not pass. There was nothing that could tremble, nothing that could interact. Here, existence is undefinable and creation is both an event and an unobservable glitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, the void suddenly disturbed. With the help of light, a flight of stairs would have hung in the black. But there was only a dark backdrop. On the top step, a head. It was not conscious, was not alive. No motion was possible in this realm, not because it could not happen, but because no one and nothing had ever tried. The head tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly, almost adamant, over the edge, down a step. No thud, a loud scream:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;DEGELHE!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flash! The flight now visible, still unreadable. If a void contains something perfectly evenly red, it is just a smear. A new perspective required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lunge out into the void, see what the world looks like! A side-view. Like blood flowing down a pitch black volcano, the stairs were nothing but a red silhouette against the nullity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;MUGHULEYA!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crack formed, the head split open. There, down in the slush, the most beautiful colors could be seen. Twisting and turning, the stairs – the world! – compacted itself by swirling into a maelstrom and disappearing, sucked into the colorful pit. Closing. Darkness again. Rumbling, shaking! Ever more violently, paving way for the final deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploding – not splitting, but exploding – into millions of colors, the head vanished. It left behind the most intricate palette of colored matter – but the matter was sad, and stayed that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Everything binomial</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/everything_binomial.html</link><pubDate>26 May 2017</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s go on a mathematical adventure! We&#x27;ll look at a couple of seemingly different things which are all actually related. First we&#x27;ll look at calculating probabilities for slot machines, then we&#x27;ll draw some spiffy triangles which make our lives easier. To finish off we&#x27;ll look at a general and very nice rule for expanding $(x + y)^n$, where n can be any positive integer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Winning at the casino&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Imagine playing a simple slot machine which has a 5% chance (probability) of you winning a single game. You have enough coins for 10 games. You wonder &quot;what&#x27;s the probability for me winning &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; 3 of these 10 games?&quot;. We can figure this out using some methods from probability theory and the information above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s give the $5\%$ probability a name. Let&#x27;s call it $p$. We say that $p = 5/100 = 0.05$. In probability theory, probabilities range between $0$ and $1$, not $0$ and $100$, so we make sure to divide percentages by $100$. Furthermore, we assign the number of games we can play to $n = 10$. The number of games we hope to win is assigned to $k = 3.$ Finally we also calculate the probability of &lt;em&gt;loosing&lt;/em&gt; a single game. Since we had $p = 0.05$, the probability of loosing is one minus $p$, let&#x27;s call this $q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$. You can think of this as subtracting the probability of winning a single game, $5\%$, from the maximum probability possible, $100\%$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probability of winning 3 out of 10 games can be calculated using what&#x27;s known as the &lt;em&gt;binomial probability mass function&lt;/em&gt;, the bin pmf. We&#x27;ll explore it in detail below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[{n \choose{k}} \cdot p^k \cdot q^{n - k} = {10 \choose{3}} \cdot 0.05^3 \cdot 0.95^7\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the $n \choose{k}$ bit, don&#x27;t fear. This bit (factor) has the dry name &lt;em&gt;binomial coeffecient&lt;/em&gt;, which simply states that it is a number in the binomial pmf. This coefficient is very nifty and can be used to figure out how many ways you can order $k$ things among a total of $n$ things. For us it represents how many ways we can arrange winning $k=3$ games out of a total of $n=10$ games. We do this because we do not know which of the 10 games we will win, so we must take into account that any 3 games of the total 10 can be won, in any order. You can think of it like this: Let W denote winning a single game and L loosing it. Then one possible order of winning 3 out of 10 games is: WWWLLLLLLL. But another one is WWLWLLLLLL. Yet another one is WWLLWLLLLL. And WLWLWLLLLL. And LLLLWWLLLW. The total number of ways to arrange the Ws and Ls is denoted $n \choose{k}$, or more specifically $10 \choose{3}$. This is equivalent to the number of ways 3 out of 10 games can be won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, ${n \choose{k}}$ is just mathematical notation, it doesn&#x27;t tell us much unless we know how to calculate it. One way is to list all possible WWWLLLLLLL-combinations and count them, but this is tedious and error-prone. A purely algebraic way is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[
\begin{aligned}
{n \choose{k}} &amp;= \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\ \\
{10 \choose{3}} &amp;= \frac{10!}{3!7!} = \frac{10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1}{3\cdot2\cdot1\cdot(7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1)} = \frac{3628800}{30240} = 120
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not be familiar with the ! in the expression above. It&#x27;s called the factorial and is simply the number in front of the ! multiplied by all numbers smaller than itself, all the way down to 1. For example $8! = 8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1$. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, now we can go back to our probability and swap ${10 \choose{3}}$ with $120$:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[{n \choose{k}} \cdot p^k \cdot q^{n - k} = {10 \choose{3}} \cdot 0.05^3 \cdot 
0.95^7 \]
\[ = 120 \cdot 0.05^3 \cdot 0.95^7 = 120 \cdot 0.000125 \cdot 0.6983 \approx 0.0105\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that if we have a slot machine with a 5% chance of winning and we want to win 3 out of 10 games, then this will occur with a 0.0105 probability, which corresponds to 1.05%. Not a great outlook in other words!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably wonder why we take $0.05$ to the power of $3$ ($0.05^3$) and $0.95$ to the power of $7$. Recall that $0.05^3$ means that we take $0.05$ times itself three times, i.e. $0.05^3 = 0.05\cdot0.05\cdot0.05$. In probability theory you can take two or more unrelated events and multiply their probabilities together in order to find the probability of all of them occurring. This is exactly what we&#x27;re doing here, the probability of winning 3 games is the probability of winning 1 game multiplied by itself 3 times. We can do this since the events are unrelated; winning one game does not affect the outcome of the next. Using the same idea we multiply the probability of loosing a game, $0.95$, with itself 7 times in order to find the probability of loosing 7 games. We then multiply the probability of winning 3 games with the probability of loosing 7 games, $0.05^3\cdot0.95^7 = 0.00008729$. This is the probability of winning 3 and loosing 7 games, but this can be done in ${10 \choose{3}} = 120$ different ways! So we just multiply the probability of the wins and losses with the number of ways it can happen, i.e. $120\cdot0.05^3\cdot0.95^7 = 0.0105$, which is our final probability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that we asked for the probability of winning &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; 3 of 10 games, not 3 or more. If we wish to calculate the probability of winning 3 or more out of 10 games, we&#x27;d have to calculate the probability of winning exactly 3 games, and the probability of winning exactly 4 games and 5 and 6 and so on up to 10. We&#x27;d then have to add these probabilities up. If you do this you&#x27;ll end up with a probability of $0.0115$, which is only slightly higher than the one for winning exactly 3 games. This is because the probability of winning 4 games is very small, winning 5 even smaller. Adding them up doesn&#x27;t do much in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making the binomial coefficient easier to calculate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above we had &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[{n \choose{k}} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} = {10 \choose{3}} = \frac{10!}{3!7!} = \frac{10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1}{3\cdot2\cdot1\cdot(7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1)}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For big values of $n$ or $k$ the fraction becomes &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; lenghty. We can make our lives easier by canceling factors in the fraction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[{10 \choose{3}} = \frac{10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot\sout{7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1}}{3\cdot2\cdot1\cdot\sout{(7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1)}} = \frac{10\cdot9\cdot8}{3\cdot2\cdot1} = \frac{720}{6} = 120\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general result of this cancellation is usually given as an explicit formula, which is handy for doing the calculation by hand (har har):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[{n \choose{k}} = \frac{n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdot...\cdot(n-k+1)}{k!}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to see how ${10 \choose{3}} = \frac{10\cdot9\cdot8}{3\cdot2\cdot1}$ would fall out of this formula. The numerator in the formula says that we should start at $10$ and then multiply it with all numbers smaller than itself all the way down to $n - k + 1 = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8$. It is especially useful when $n$ is big and $k$ is small, since we get way fewer factors than with our previous formula. For situations where $n$ is big and $k$ is close to $n$, it gives little help since just a few factors will cancel. Note that $k$ can never be bigger than $n$ nor can any of $n$ or $k$ be less than zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another, more graphic and mnemonic-y way of finding the value of a specific binomial coefficient. Let&#x27;s draw Pascal&#x27;s triangle!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pascal pascal-big&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing this 7 more times should produce the big triangle we used to calculate $10 \choose {3}$ above. Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pascal&#x27;s triangle is named after the French mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal. He&#x27;s known for  Pascal&#x27;s law, which describes transmission of fluid pressure. The SI-unit for pressure, Pascal, is named after him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The binomial theorem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever memorized that $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$? Maybe $(x + y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3$? How about memorizing $(x + y)^4$? Have no fear, the &lt;em&gt;binomial theorem&lt;/em&gt; is here (also called &lt;em&gt;binomial expansion&lt;/em&gt;). It is a theorem which can be used to calculate a binomial to any power. A binomial is just a polynomial with exactly two terms, hence the &lt;em&gt;bi&lt;/em&gt; in the name. Examples are $(x + y)$, $(3x + 1)$, $(a + z)$ or whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The binomial theorem looks very similar to the binomial probability mass function, in fact it looks just like a sum of several bin pmf:s. Here are two examples for different powers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[
\begin{aligned}\\
(x + y)^2 &amp;= {2 \choose{0}}x^0y^2 + {2 \choose{1}}x^{1}y^{1} + {2 \choose{2}}x^{2}y^0 \\ \\
          &amp;= 1y^2 + 2xy + 1x^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[
\begin{aligned}\\
(x + y)^3 &amp;= {3 \choose{0}}x^0y^3 + {3 \choose{1}}x^1y^2 + {3 \choose{2}}x^2y^1 + {3 \choose{3}}x^3y^0\\ \\
          &amp;= 1y^3 + 3xy^2 + 3x^2y + 1x^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the pattern? For the sake of consistency I start with the terms in the same order as in the bin pmf, but I flip everything around at the last equals sign to make them look like the rules you might have memorized. Also, recall that any number taken to the power of $0$ equals $1$, that&#x27;s why $x^0 = 1$ and $y^0 = 1$ above vanish, multiplying with $1$ does nothing. Together with Pascal&#x27;s triangle, binomial expansions to high powers can easily be &quot;remembered&quot;. Let&#x27;s do one to the power of $5$. Here&#x27;s a Pascal&#x27;s triangle with 6 rows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pascal pascal-6&quot;&gt;
\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp;    &amp;    &amp;    &amp;    &amp;    &amp;  1  &amp;    &amp;    &amp;    &amp;    &amp;\\
&amp;    &amp;    &amp;    &amp;    &amp;  1 &amp;     &amp;  1 &amp;    &amp;    &amp;    &amp;\\
&amp;    &amp;    &amp;    &amp; 1  &amp;    &amp;  2  &amp;    &amp; 1  &amp;    &amp;    &amp;\\
&amp;    &amp;    &amp;  1 &amp;    &amp;  3 &amp;     &amp;  3 &amp;    &amp; 1  &amp;    &amp;\\
&amp;    &amp;  1 &amp;    &amp;  4 &amp;    &amp;  6  &amp;    &amp;  4 &amp;    &amp; 1  &amp;\\
&amp;  1 &amp;    &amp;  5 &amp;    &amp; 10 &amp;     &amp; 10 &amp;    &amp;  5 &amp;    &amp;1
\end{aligned}
\]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s write out the binomial expansion using the pattern above, looking up binomial coefficients in the triangle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[
\begin{aligned}
(x + y)^5 &amp;= {5 \choose{0}}x^0y^5 + {5 \choose{1}}x^1y^4 + {5 \choose{2}}x^2y^3 + {5 \choose{3}}x^3y^2 \\ \\
          &amp;+ {5 \choose{4}}x^4y^1 + {5 \choose{5}}x^5y^0
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that all the binomial coefficients are on the form $5 \choose{n}$, meaning that all of them are on the 6:th, the last, row in the triangle. In fact, the coefficients can be read straight off this row:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[
\begin{aligned}
(x + y)^5 &amp;= 1x^0y^5 + 5x^1y^4 + 10x^2y^3 + 10x^3y^2 + 5x^4y^1 + 1x^5y^0 \\ \\
&amp;= 1y^5 + 5xy^4 + 10x^2y^3 + 10x^3y^2 + 5x^4y + 1x^5 \\ \\
&amp;= x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ta-da! You can now more easily remember how to write crazy-big binomial expansions. Drawing Pascal&#x27;s triangle and doing all this might not be fast, but it&#x27;s an easy enough way to remember it all. It&#x27;s better to use dumb, slow methods and be correct than to use fast, smart methods and make silly mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last thing. There&#x27;s a shorter, more general way of writing the binomial theorem, using a sum-sign:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\[(x + y)^n = \sum\limits_{k=0}^n{n \choose{k}}x^ky^{n - k}\]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $\sum$ says that we should start with $k = 0$ and calculate the stuff to the right of the $\sum$ using $k = 0$ and then set $k = 1$ and calculate the stuff again using that and do this again and again all the way until $k = n$. We then add all the calculated parts together. Try doing this for $n = 2$ and $n = 3$, the examples at the start of this section should fall out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!

Long past dusk, but the path still visible,
a thermos my only luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the stream a bridge was built.
Rocks thereunder suffice as chair.

these colors live their nightly life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brought no companion,
only this hot beverage

The sky was dark, purple and a heavy yellow moon hung high above. At first everything was quiet, but gradually the wind began picking up speed until it howled and the light drizzle turned into rain that whipped and whipped against his skin. Lightning struck, many bolts, coming closer. He was getting very cold, shivering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deafening sound, a blinding light and all around him the trees exploded into fire. &quot;WHERE AM I?&quot; he screamed, terrified. Lightning struck again and again. Eventually it formed a standing wall of vertical bolts, shaped like a circle, in which he was trapped. The electric and fiery light shone like flickering floodlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this beyond surreal world he sat down on his knees, whimpering. From outside the wall of flames and bolts a hand reached out to him, as if it wanted him to grab it. He hesitated, and then went for it. He grabbed and pulled. The body to which the hand was attached flew towards him, midair the head looked up. It was badly scorched. No hair, the skin cracked and dry. He sat huddled in the middle of this electric inferno, screaming in horror, looking at the body of his long-gone friend.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sleeping is hard</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/sleeping_is_hard.html</link><pubDate>17 May 2017</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something truly annoying about having lots of things to do, going to bed and then finding yourself wide awake, hoping that it&#x27;ll be morning soon so you can do those things. After lying there for three hours and coming to the conclusion that your sleeping isn&#x27;t going so well you think &quot;well maybe I should go up and do that thing!&quot; but now you&#x27;ve been in bed for so long that it would be ludicrous to do so! You might fall asleep at any moment. Now you become irritated that you wasted all these hours lying in bed, not sleeping when you could have done that thing.

Maybe I was fed up with whatever I was doing, maybe I needed some air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I take walks because it feels like there&#x27;s something heavy inside my chest, a kind of unrest. At those moments I try taking really deep breaths, because it feels like it might help. It feels like the depth of my breaths—how filled my lungs get—have a threshold. It feels like if a single breath was to get past that threshold, the heavy feeling would subside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it&#x27;s not unusual for me to find myself walking around, breathing deeply, focused, hunting for that threshold. If I&#x27;m unlucky, the heaviness stays. But in a few cases, after walking around outside for a couple of minutes, I successfully inhale so deeply that the threshold is overwon and during the following exhale I feel a big, fuzzy calm take hold of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like those moments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A short life and a pile of papers</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/a_short_life_and_a_pile_of_papers.html</link><pubDate>07 May 2017</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have pages upon pages of short stories, lyrics, thoughts and feelings written down. On pieces of papers scattered throughout my bedroom. On my computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout my twenties I have attempted a lot of hobbies. I recently realized that the only one—except fiddling around with computers and playing guitar—that has stuck around is writing. It comes to me naturally to just start typing or writing whenever I feel empty inside or when something huge wants to come out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This realization made me think that it&#x27;s probably better for me to focus on the hobbies that come naturally by having the tools around to do them. If it&#x27;s painting or drawing, I&#x27;ll have those tools around me. If it&#x27;s playing music, I&#x27;ll have my instruments at hand. I&#x27;ll surround myself with the stuff I need in order to spontaneously do the things I might like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I surround myself with these things without anything happening, I will not attempt to force it anymore.

His clothes consisted of a tracksuit, and the blond hair was in a bun on the top back of his head, as was fashionable at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His steps were casual. He was eating a banana. When the banana was almost consumed, maybe having 1/3 left of it&#x27;s fruity innards, he saw someone approach him down the street. The person approaching was to him unknown, and he held IKEA-bags. The bags were presumably filled with clothes, as revealed by him heading for the small house in which laundry was done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person with the bun, tracksuit and banana froze in his walk. The laundry man looked up, confused. As if entering a battle stance the frozen man aggressively threw his almost eaten banana in the ground and produced, maybe hidden in his other hand, maybe from his pockets, two small wooden sticks. The stick were about 20 centimeters long, maybe 2 centimeters in diameter and were covered with really beautiful carvings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in this battle stance, with the laundry man by now looking slightly afraid, he began hitting the sticks together, over his head, playing a kind of catchy rhythm &quot;tock tock tocktock, tock tock tocktock, tock tock tocktock&quot;. Holding his legs stiff and shuffling around, he moved around like a monkey hitting two interesting items together in the hopes of scaring something away (or something, I don&#x27;t know anything about monkeys!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now the laundry man found the whole situation slightly uncomfortable. He did not seem to know or recall ever meeting this track-suited loony. The door to the laundry was closer to him, and he went towards it, going out of sight from the other. The man with the sticks immediately stopped playing. But before being able to enter the laundry house, the man with the sticks had rounded the corner of the building, seen the man again and jumped straight into the same pose and played his melody until the other disappeared into the laundry house with his IKEA-bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man in the tracksuit was later seen standing still on a lawn, checking his phone, during a hail storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The situation above was seen from my bedroom window&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A really secure bed in the darkness</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/a_really_secure_bed_in_the_darkness.html</link><pubDate>03 May 2017</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late at night. I really have to sleep. There are things to do tomorrow, I don&#x27;t have time to be awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it is during these hours that the world and all solutions to our problems seem so simple. Sometimes, when trying to sleep, a thought train leaves the station of my mind and slowly I start thinking of all my problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During these hours, the problems, they have obvious solutions. Especially the really personal problems. That thing I always wanted to discuss with him, it seemed so simple, I felt like I could just do it. I would get it over with. That awkward way in which I speak whenever I feel insecure, the fix was dead simple. I would just walk into situations and say the straight thing and be dead sure about it. I feel that tomorrow will be the dawn of the really secure me. Those problems with emotions that I don&#x27;t know how to convey, those would be said out loud. There, in the security of my bed, there, in the darkness, I&#x27;m not afraid of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawn comes. I charge into the new day, tired from lack of sleep from the night before, but I still believe. But then the day slowly wears me down. I get into an insecure situation and I&#x27;m even more awkward than the day before. Feelings of anxiety strike me if I try to figure how how to approach him. The emotions I fail to convey are even more shrouded than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was typed from the security of my bed, in the darkness. The time is 01:56. I feel very sure about these words, but I&#x27;m sure tomorrow has something else in store.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Habits, hands, Bamse</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/habits_hands_bamse.html</link><pubDate>02 May 2017</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s often said that it takes a couple of weeks to create a new habit or destroy an old one.

The motivation for this is is that we live in a world surrounded by technical gadgets and that a deeper understanding for these things could improve our everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I support this idea, I think some people take it a bit too far, without looking at the big picture. Some make is sound like programming should be a big subject next to other, more universal things like language, history and maths. This I do not agree with. Programming is just one part of the tech that surrounds us, but it&#x27;s easy to forget that there is actually hardware in these things, circuits that have been meticulously designed in order for the software to even have something to run on. There are also other things involved, such as the AC-power leading up to your house, and how that electricity is produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I&#x27;m trying to get at is that, yes we should probably teach kids a bit more about computers, but that also includes making sure they understand the basics of the electronics that make up the hardware. A broadened technical subject in elementary school were kids get to build simple circuit boards, do a bit of soldering, get a taste for repairing stuff and on top of that maybe try some programming is what I think we need. It doesn&#x27;t have to be much, it doesn&#x27;t have to be several times a week for several years, it can be like once a week for one year. Primarily it should be inspiring and eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually had a subject called &quot;technology&quot; in 8:th grade and we got to do the stuff above, except for programming. We soldered circuit boards that played music when connected to a 9 v battery, we learned how to change an AC-plug and some very basic electronics theory. However, few of my Swedish friends seem to have done this (so much for a standardized school system!), and it&#x27;s sad because it was for me one of the most fun and inspiring parts of elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I repair electronics, I&#x27;m often reminded of that component-filled room with the slightly weird teacher and people poking away with soldering irons.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Neuralt fummel (Swedish)</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/neutralt_fummel.html</link><pubDate>15 Jan 2017</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denna eviga förvirring.
Jag sitter var dag och funderar.
Vad är det som skall komma härnäst;
sorg, glädje, rädsla eller ilska?
Mina tankar blandas timme in och ut.
Hur det nu än blir så vet jag säkert,
att barndommens lätta sinne
i en evig neural storm har gömts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under promenaden in till staden,
i öronen det otäcka programmet.
Berättelser om vem som lever,
berättelser om vem som dör,
sorgen i att åt andra tvingas välja.
Medan tåget genom kylan lunka fram,
ett mörker över mig sakta sjunka.
Jag får hålla mig från att
i oförklarlig vrede och förvirring,
rakt ut i vagnen börja gasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stopp. Tåget har rullat in på station,
ett annat jag måste finna.
I väntan jag står och uppmärksammar:
Ögon ögon ögon som stirrar överallt,
alla tankar, all historia,
som bor dessa i väderbitna personer.
Ögon möter mig och jag funderar om
min förvirrade blick de försöker tyda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tåget anländer, fötterna går ombord,
det är en underjordisk rälsbuss.
Medan den för mig mot yttre ort,
damen i gången läser en karta.
Underbart att inte veta vart man ska
tänker jag som vet vart, men inte varför,
jag far dit jag far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rälsen stannar, tåget går av.
Katakomberna sluter sig kring mig,
vilket utgång bör jag ta?
Jag går upp åt ett håll,
fast vänder ner igen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nu kom jag rätt, här har jag varit.
Fötterna går ner för gatan, ögonen ser huset.
Fummel fummel. Långsamma, kalla fingrar.
Siffra siffra siffra siffra. Klick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upp högst upp, men inte upp till vinden.
Jag ringer på, min vän öppnar och
med ett leende mig möter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hur är läget?&quot;
&quot;Jo, det är väl helt okej.&quot;

Money is a prison. When you have enough you subscribe to this and that thing until you are locked into a cage from which you have little hope of escaping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since resigning from my most recent job in February I have had a growing feeling that I never want to work again. This is, in the modern world, a problem. My mere existence forces me to every month pay money to a handful corporations in order to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now I&#x27;m studying physics at university and I&#x27;m very happy about it. I have no real plans of what I&#x27;m going to do with whatever it is that I learn, but at least I get to do something interesting. Here there is no boss assessing whatever I do. There is no one that cares about what I do, and it&#x27;s the best thing ever. Having someone judge your daily achievements is for me a horrible way to spend your days I hope I never have to experience it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I hear friends saying &quot;I just want to finish the education and get a job&quot; and I freeze. The thought that I too, some day, must return to my old place in the big wheel, is frightening. I don&#x27;t want to. Education in Sweden is free and I get a monthly free grant plus loan which will last for another three years. This is roughly the time it will take me to get my bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics. What I&#x27;ll do after that I do not know. What I&#x27;m gonna do this summer, in order to pay the rent the couple of summer months where I don&#x27;t get the study grant, I do not know. I do not want to work. But I guess I can put up with like one month of work during the beginning of the summer, scraping together barley enough for the rest of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll find something that works for me at some point. Maybe by making indie games. Maybe I&#x27;ll somehow fund a master&#x27;s degree in aerospace engineering or physics. I&#x27;m not gonna try to plan these things, but I&#x27;m actively going to stay away from working tiring jobs that subtract from life quality more than they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just want to be free.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On writing games from scratch</title><link>http://zylinski.se/post/on_creating_games_from_scratch.html</link><pubDate>07 Feb 2016</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been writing some quite grumpy posts on Twitter regarding third-party game engines, so I felt it was time to do a write-up on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every now and then people find out that some game which has been released recently was written from scratch, meaning it did not use any third-party game engine. Whenever this is found out about I often start hearing comments from game devs and gamers like &quot;yeah well that game didn&#x27;t need to have it&#x27;s own engine&quot; or &quot;the cost of making the game could probably have been reduced a lot if they went with something like Unity&quot;. Sure, if you are a game developer that likes using something like Unity, then fine, use that engine as long as you like it and you&#x27;re happy developing using it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that by making your own engine, or &lt;em&gt;writing from scratch&lt;/em&gt; as I prefer to call it, you usually do not mean making a general-purpose engine before you start making the game. In most cases it means creating a specific-purpose monolithic program where the &quot;engine part&quot; and game is just one big program, created in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that I usually work in small to medium-sized teams. I do not work in large teams (AAA etc), therefore I have no strong opinions on how I&#x27;d like to make games in such teams. This text is not going to be some &quot;there is one correct ultimate way to make games&quot;-thing. It all boils down to what a game developer likes and what makes them happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The joy of programming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I have been working for a while at a company where we use Unreal Engine 4 for our game. The game is looking great. I love the team. But I really don&#x27;t enjoy the day-to-day work, all because of one thing: I do not find it fun to program in Unreal. And by &quot;not finding it fun&quot; I mean that actually typing the code and reasoning about how to transfer the problem in my head into lines of code just isn&#x27;t fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some Unreal-specific and some non-Unreal-specific reasons for me feeling like this. I don&#x27;t want to go into the details of the Unreal-specific reasons now, but let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a combination of the following: Really really bad iteration times. Forcing you to use what I think is a bad sub-set of C++. The bad iteration times in combination with the bad sub-set of C++ makes you write more than you want in Unreal&#x27;s visual scripting language Blueprint. Blueprint has pretty neat iteration times, but is near-impossible to refactor when shit hits the fan. I can literally count on my fingers the times I&#x27;ve found excitement and a general &lt;em&gt;joy of programming&lt;/em&gt; while using Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this lack of joy made me work slower. I think people underestimate how important the joy of programming is. I feel like I&#x27;m at 10% effectiveness whenever I&#x27;m unhappy writing code. Whenever I feel like I&#x27;m doing something slower than I can, I feel stressed. And when I feel like I do things slower than I can on daily basis, I get chronically stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been working in Unreal for the whole summer and fall of 2015 and I really really tried to pull myself through it. I wanted to work on this great game with these great people. But it turned out to be the most stressful period of my life and I have not been feeling well because of it. Because of some piece of software. It may sound like I&#x27;m a spoiled kid for not having worse problems. Sure, I have had an otherwise very problem-free 2015. Any other big crisis would probably have overshadowed these problems. But still, it is what has been eating me, driving me nuts and stressing me out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m simply put the wrong person to be working on a project using Unreal. My co-workers don&#x27;t seem feel nearly as frustrated by Unreal and I&#x27;m glad that they are happy and continue working on our great game. But I have because of these issues resigned from my job. My last day will be February 29, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about other engines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At this point someone probably thinks that if I was working on a project which used Unity I would have none of the above problems. Yes, Unity has neater iteration times. It does few of the weird things with the programming that Unreal does. It is substantially more fun to code using it. I have used Unity for lots of game jams and I find it great for such purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this text is more about my feelings working on longer projects. In a long project that uses Unity I still feel substantially less joy than if I had written the game from scratch. All developers have different tastes in how to create. Just like Bob Ross paints everything using primarily two big brushes and a paint knife, all game developers have their own personal style when creating games. Some don&#x27;t want to be concerned with what happens under the hood, only writing gameplay scripts on top an opaque engine. Others are driven by knowing what the computer is actually doing, ultimately having to craft most of the program themselves. I know I am the latter but I think both ways are fine and it is in choosing what suits you that you stay happy and less stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Changing stuff up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ron Gilbert recently wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thimbleweedpark.com/engine&quot;&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt; about engines on the Thimbleweed Park blog from which this quote comes: &quot;I started to take a close look at engines that were suitable for a 2D point &amp; click game. Lots of great choices, but deep down (if I&#x27;m honest with myself), I&#x27;m a game engine snob. Whenever I use an engine, I keep wanting to modify it and hack into it to do what I need. I guess I&#x27;ve found over the years that it&#x27;s a lot easier (and less stressful) for me if I just create my own.&quot;. Something that really resonated with me was, for previously explained reasons, the &quot;and less stressful&quot; parenthesis, but also the part about modifying the engine to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most complex third-party engines often need surgery. Some of them don&#x27;t come with source, which is deal-breaker for me if I&#x27;m gonna do a longer project. But even if you manage to get source access you suddenly have a new set of problems. As you start hacking into the source and make your modifications you probably, unless it&#x27;s late in the project, regularly update to newer versions of the engine. With enough modifications in your own version of the engine the merges with new versions get so time-consuming that you start restraining yourself from changing the engine in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might also do engine surgery the Unreal-way where everything is super object-oriented and you create your own subclass of the vanilla engine class and completely override functions in the engine. But this is also a bad idea! Suddenly you&#x27;re leaving dead code everywhere, making browsing through the engine source harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It&#x27;s just a program!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I code I strive for making tidy and lean solutions that gets the job done. Using a general-purpose game engine kind of takes you in the opposite direction. You probably only use a portion of the features in the engine, making a big chunk of your game&#x27;s collective code into bloat. All of the unused features are just noise there to distract you as you find your way through the engine code, looking for that thing you wanted to change. When I write from scratch I feel at ease because I think of all the code usually found in general-purpose engines that I &lt;em&gt;avoided&lt;/em&gt; having in my game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that a program should be as clear as possible and contain only the stuff it actually needs. And as I see it, a game is just a program! For me it makes sense to have a single monolithic program where engine and game code live in symbiosis. It&#x27;s a program where I can throw out whatever code I feel without remorse. It&#x27;s a program where I know that most of the code is used. It&#x27;s a program where I have a chance to understand how everything works. And most importantly, it&#x27;s a program that was fun to create.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item>
