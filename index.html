        <div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/brain_dump_2018_01_06.html'>January  6, 2019</a><div class="post"><h1>Brain dump 2019-01-06</h1><p></p><p><em>Warning: This is mostly unedited rambling.</em></p><p>I am no pessimist, I just think a lot. These days I barley listen to music. I used to have my headphones on at all times outside, there was always some album that was the "current" one, looping. Now all that surrounds me is silence, and I enjoy it. Walks, several hour long walks, in silence. No, not silence, there is some kind of noise, in my head, but that is just me pondering. The thoughts can be classified into two categories. The first one is idle chatter, like small talk, I might run through things, plans, situations – nothing of big importance. I often make up music, there is often a "song of the day"; some loop that was made up somewhere in there, I found it appealing, it keeps repeating. Funny, I don't listen to music, so I sub-consciously make music. Anyways, this category is the "I don't have a lot on my mind". It is sort of a relaxed state. Sometimes I don't think about anything at all. Sometimes I try to not think of anything at all, most of above is after all just nonsense. Except the music bit, I think allowing yourself to make up small tunes is good. Why, I do not know. I come up with such a multitude of little songs (not that I record them in any way, some stick for a long time, but almost all of them disappear in due time) that I have been thinking "oh my, maybe I should focus my time on being a musician". Stuff just seems to fall out without effort from somewhere deep within me. Perhaps that is how you should choose what to do in life. Just sit still, don't do anything. See what comes out spontaneously and refine that.</p><p>Anyways, the other category of brain-noise is more like some sort of serious debate. You know, whatever happens when you have problems and your brain goes back and forth about it. I have this little habit, which I know at least one other friend also has, to make almost a "play" in my head. You know, like a stage play. It is usually when the whatever is bothering or consuming me includes a real person. I simulate the conversation I know I will have or want to have. Often it can be helpful, but sometimes I guess it's a bit harmful because I build this idea of how people are going to respond and when I actually have the real conversation nothing is every really like I thought. It always starts out completely different than I imagined and then people don't react like I thought. But ah, whatever, I think I do this less often now. Most of my "play" conversation are instead about important topics that I want to discuss, sometimes I just seem to have a discussion with some arbitrary, shapeless person. It's not a preparation for a specific conversation, I just try to make my thoughts cohesive. I think this version of these little plays are good, because everything becomes untangled and I can express ideas clearly at later points. Oh well, yeah, the make-believe-conversion-with-friend is probably not 100% good, but I have started dispelling them with this mantra: "except for things that are set in stone, nothing will ever turn out like expected". I think it's neat.</p><p>One thing I have been thinking about is what we humans do to ourselves and our planet and how it will end and all that. It has been said that in order to make the required changes to stop climate change, we would need to put society into a state of war-like rationing. Especially in countries like Sweden. My mother is a teacher for 7-9 graders and she asked them what impact they think swedes have on the environment. There was this green-politics-aware student who thought we were so good because we recycle and buy organic stuff and whatnot. But turns out that we are among the worst. Well, good that we recycle, but why do we have so much to recycle in the first place? Even with trends of second-hand shopping and all that, we are still insane over-consumers. Swedes consume like we have slightly more than 4 planets to spare. So something radical has to be done about that! It must be the first stop of all green political efforts. A radical shift away from consumerism. People at the top needs to stand up and say "hey, it's ok to live a basic life. We don't need to have all these things. It's perfectly possible to have the good, happy life while not consuming so much." But they don't. Even the most green of political parties in Sweden seem to be caught up in introducing policies that will slightly shift behaviors in some desired direction. But it is not enough. I don't get how they are able to look themselves in the mirror and call themselves the green party. With the challenges of today, being green MUST mean that you are radically anti-consumerist and it must become an ok idea to broadcast to the public. Looking at what these politicians want to do, if they got their own majority, is laughable. Even if we did everything that the Swedish green party wanted we would still need more than one planet.</p><p>Another thing about these parties – be it the green party or the left party (which are supposed to be "as green") – is the incompatibility of the green ideas and their economy politics. Like I said, they need to be radical anti-consumerists and they need to be it yesterday. But these are parties that are bound up in the normal capitalist economy, they are part of it and thus even they speak of "green ways" achieve economic growth... If we were to be more radically anti-consumerist, then we would have to have a negative economic growth, the whole "developed world" needs to. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. If we want to move from requiring 4 planets to less than 1, then humongous changes need to be put in place. This is the state of war-like rationing I mentioned. But since we are so used to having everything, being able to "be free" by spending money on whatever we want, it would be very hard to introduce any such system. There might even break out civil war. Or something. Bad stuff would happen. All this because we THINK that we are free, the feeling of freedom coming from the fact that we know that we can use our money to buy stuff, go anywhere. But we are bound up, like slaves. We have been tricked into having to work long hours to pay for lots of stuff we don't need in order to destroy the only thing we do need, our home. Because of this, because we are like insane addicts who would go rampage if anything drastically changed and because this drastic change needs to happen I am fairly sure society as we know it is fucked. We who are young today are likely to see the fall of modern civilization. I don't think everyones gonna die or anything, but lots will. There will be refugees.</p><p>This is really just a manifestation of a more general thing, that radical change cannot happen without there being a vacuum. The world is like that. New types of government cannot be tested without a power vacuum. I like giving the example of Rojava in northern Syria, an autonomous region where they have flipped the pyramid of power in society upside down, utilizing what I think is best described as anarchism-with-a-framework. They were able to get so far with this because of the power vacuum in the region. Something similar will happen with the world with regards to climate change. As the whole planet goes into a state of emergency and state after state breaks into pieces, people will look back and see how they were tricked into working far more than they needed so that they could buy things they didn't need in order to destroy the planet they needed. There will be new societies, doing right what we did not, but the road there will be filled with incomprehensible suffering.</p><p>I will now start the last semester of my bachelor in physics and astronomy. I often joke that I completely switch direction in life every third year. Up until a couple of months ago, I was fairly sure that I would stay on the physics track, even get a master degree in astronomy. But thing is, I have recently begun to doubt the whole point of it all. I have learned a lot and it has given me fantastic insight and I have even noticed positive effects in other parts of life. For example, my problem-solving abilities have improved dramatically. I sat down and did some 3D programming last year and complex things like 3D collision detection and collision solving was actually pretty doable, because I was able to methodically break it down in a nice way. I felt like I was able to quickly solve complicated and sticky problems while also having fun, where I would previously have been mostly upset. Anyways, I haven't completely decided on what to do. If I do continue with the 2-year-master then I will probably go to Edinburgh for my first year (unless Brexit fucks everything up). The primary reason for going isn't that I think I will learn more astronomy that way (I think I would be able to be more focused and organized if I didn't go), it is simply that I would like to live in an English-speaking community for an extended period of time, I think that will give my English skills that extra flare that I can achieve in Swedish, both written and spoken. The reason I might not continue is simply that I probably don't want to work in the field, I study it mostly out of curiosity. Also, I have been thinking about how I actually would want to go about life outside of university. My thinking is like this. People are to isolated nowadays. We do not help each other like we ought to. Help can't be free, if I were to go out there and just try to help people they might even find it suspicious that someone would like to help just like that. If you want help, then you pay someone to do it. We have stopped talking to each other, creating an economic bubble around us and we interact with the unknown world using our wallets. We are truly more lonely and isolated than ever. I don't want that. I am seriously thinking about living someplace cheap, working a few days a week and then just trying to organize myself in helping those that need it most. It seems like the antidote I think the world needs. I much rather to this than going back to working full-time and trying to do meaningful things in between.</p></div></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/ketsket.html'>May 29, 2018</a><div class="post"><h1>Ketsket (Swedish)</h1><p></p><p>Ett knippe strålar målar genom dansande damm en vägg rödspräcklig. På sängen en någon, ett något. En varelse, en person?</p><p>Mot sängkanten, bort från väggen rullade Den; fötter lades på golvet. Släpande fötter släpade sig bort mot gläntade dörr, det dansande dammets ljuskällor skymdes tillfälligt under passagen. Utanför dörren hände en korridor och stegen närmade sig ett pentry. Vatten hettades i gammal bucklig el-manick, troligen hemmabygge, troligen resterande ting i huset likaså. Väggen över el-manicken var täckt av spikar spikar spikar, livlina åt ett myller av köksattiraljer, en av dem en mugg. Muggen var nu på träbänken – den träbänk som tycktes växa fram ur väggen eftersom den var nära besläktad med såväl väggar som golv som tak. Tebladen kastades i muggen utan att omslutas av vare sig kula eller påse, vatten av godtycklig varmhet hälldes över.</p><p>Fötterna, aningen mindre släpande, släpstegade sig bort mot korridorens kortsida och dess dörr. Dra handtaget inåt och uppåt, ett reflexmässigt knyck. In flödade ljus, ut flödade Den. Hit, till balkongen, rann solens röda strålar obehindrat. Muggen placerades på litet bord intill enkel stol, på vilken Den nu satt. Den, bordet och stolen omslöts av ett räcke som då och då avbröts av träpelare. Dessa pelare hade som uppdrag att hålla taket uppe – det tak som hängde över balkongen för att skydda mot det regn som aldrig föll från den himmel som aldrig sett ett moln.</p><p>Kopp på bord, kropp på stol. Ögonen vandrade över räcket och föll långt långt ned till det blågröna gräset som dansade sin kontinuerliga dans. Havslikt flödade vågor av ständig bris över meterhöga strån. Den sippade på teet; agerade munsil. Bittert, ja. Vinden vände och blicken började surfa, släpades ut till havs av gräsvågor som lämnade hemmet. Bort bort bortåt, mot kanten på alltet. Fixerad på krusningarna kändes det som om hela huset rörde på sig. Än dög den. Än dög synen av hur balkongräckets bruna, kråkslottiga form bröts av mot det blågröna vaggande gräshavet som sträckte sig hela vägen bort till det horisontella gränssnitt där hav övergick i röd, arg himmel, vars ilska kulminerade i den rosenrasande solen.</p><p>Surfandet fortskred tills teet var slut och muggen tillbaka på sin hemspik. Promenaden nedåt inleddes. Våning efter våning, ned ned ned. På många våningar rummen knappt klara – en stackare hade oturen att sakna en hel vägg, fick nöja sig med bärande pelare. Ned ned ned, timmar passerade.</p><p>Framme, bottenvåning. Här bodde någon förr, men inte nu. Beviset ännu ett pentry samt en före detta säng; sned, trasig och ledsen. Ytterdörr fanns på plats – men Den gick inte dit, utan sökte sig till ännu en trappa. Nedåtgående trappor leder från en bottenvåning under botten: en källare fuktig och sval. Här nere fanns en öppning i underjorden som ledde till en tunnel där stödbjälkar gruvschaktslikt höll jorden kvar. Den tände ögonen och försvann in i mörkret.</p><p>Tunneln smal, låg i tak och tilläts inte hålla på länge innan en sväng avbröt och tog Den in i ett mindre bergrum. Hål i tak gjorde rummet skumt rödbelyst och tillhandahöll ett rep som rakt ner hängde. Likt kristallstrukturer reste de sig ur tak, ur väggar och ur golv, hopande likt blombuketter. Vissa flera meter i höjd, andra bara stumpar. På en bukett fanns såväl plank som balk, ett i synnerhet varierat exemplar. Den stod framför denna fina samling, lade huvudet bestämt på sned varpå det första trästycket föll – en halvmeter lång planka, kapad från roten. Skörden blev ett tjugotal korta plankor och två långa balkar, runt vilka repet från ovan knöts. Den gick ut genom tunnel, upp ur källare, ut genom rosa ytterdörr och fann vid kanten av blågrön havsäng ett hål med tillhörande rep. Lasten drogs upp, hamnade framför huset.</p><p>Stående vid trähög tilläts blicken promenera upp för huset. De första våningarna hela och raka, skapta med omsorg. Därefter en tilltagande vårdslöshet; de korrekt dragna linjerna knycklades till, våningarna snabbt hopslagda, prydda av halvfärdiga väggar och vinda knutar. Den backade och lät blicken fortsätta uppåt uppåt uppåt. Det makalösa bygget reste sig, våningar staplade på varandra – vissa större än de under, vissa mindre. Det blågröna havet prasslade. Den varma brisen fläktade. Den rosenrasande solen lyste, fastspikad. Den lyste på hus och hav, men också på en kamrat. En kall kamrat som hängde högt ovan och kände sig utpekad av den mest osannolika skyskrapa ingen någonsin skådat.</p><p>Virkeshögens viloplats var i själva verket en plattform som var kopplad till en kätting som i sin tur försvann upp i oändligheten. Stående på plattformen intill virket grep Den med en precis rörelse tag i kättingen. Ögonen drog ihop sig, handen knöts hårt, som om djup koncentration behövde infinna sig. Lika oväntat som verkligheten accelererade plattformen uppåt. På bara några sekunder var marken därunder ett myller av blågrönt där separata grässtrån inte längre gick att urskilja. Luftmotståndet sade sitt; ett oerhört susande och vinande. Upp upp upp, våning våning våning susade förbi, nästan som om Den föll uppåt. Långt där nere började den tidigare platta världen förvridas, horisonten sjönk som om någon dragit ur badkarets propp, randen mellan gräshav och upprörd himmel drog ihop sig till en cirkel, till en sfär. Timmar hade passerat då Den och lasten med en försiktig inbromsning anlände till översta våning.</p><p>På toppen av denna spik, som växte ur den nu knytnävsstora bollen, fanns ännu ett ofärdigt rum. Men Den ämnade inte att färdigställa det. Istället lyftes blicken uppåt. Precis ovanför hängde ett grått tak: solens kalla kamrat. Från markplan hade världen tyckts platt och kamraten sfärisk. De hade nu bytt roller och Den såg kamrattakets yta sträcka sig bort mot ofantligheten – en inverterad horisont. Solen fick takets märkliga, grå material att skimra likt en sjö.</p><p>Det trä som hade följt med upp fördelades på golvet. Två långa balkar parallellt med korta plankor tvärs över, jämna mellanrum. Blicken fästes på en av mötespunkterna mellan plank och balk och de smalt omedelbart samman. Proceduren upprepades tills den cirka fyra meter långa stegen var färdig.</p><p>Fastkilad i ett av golvets jack restes stegen; dess topp slog emot en grå bumling på kamratens yta och Den var precis i färd med att ta det första klivet då benen hejdade sig. Ivriga steg stegade istället ned för trappan till våningen under. Några dagar senare kom Den tillbaka, bärande på stolen som inte längre stod på balkongen. Stol under arm, fot på nedersta steg; det första klivet upp, och det andra och det tredje... </p><p>Nu, nära nog takets yta för Den att vidröra om så villes, ställdes stolen upp i taket. Den stod kvar. Ett tak utan bjälkar är ett golv. Tvekets korta stund följdes av trevande hand, sträckte sig uppåt. Fingerspetsens vidrödande utav kamratens kalla yta fick världen att vända. Den störtade med armarna först mot taket som var golvet som var kamraten. Oskadd reste Den sig, nu med fötter på det hårda, dammiga underlaget.</p><p>Stolen justerades så den stod precis under – ovan? – ovanunder rummet Den just hade lämnat. Den satte sig i stolen, lät blicken färdas ett varv. Runtom stod det grå landskapet öde. Rakt framför skickade solen ut sina rosenrasande strålar, gjorde vistelsen behaglig. Ovanför, långt där uppe, hängde en liten blågrön sfär ur vilken en kil av trä reste sig mot pannan. Blicken återvände mot solen och Den blev på stolen för evigt sittandes.</p></div></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/generating_static_webpages.html'>April  9, 2018</a><div class="post"><h1>Generating static web pages</h1><p></p><p>I just finished updating this site a bit, making blog posts appear on the index page, generally making it more "bloggy". When I made the site I knew I did not want any comments section on the blog, so I figured I might as well generate the whole thing offline! This approach is quite minimalistic and requires little server-side infrastructure.</p><p>The generating is done using <a href="https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl-zylinski.github.io/blob/master/build.py">this Python script</a>. It takes <a href="https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl-zylinski.github.io/blob/master/template.html">this template</a> in which it finds where to inject the header and content. After that it scans <a href="https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl-zylinski.github.io/tree/master/content">this folder</a> for .html-files from which the non-blog-post pages are generated.</p><p>The generating of blog posts is hard-wired to look inside the folder <a href="https://github.com/karl-zylinski/karl-zylinski.github.io/tree/master/content/posts">content/posts</a>. Every file in there is then parsed, translating the minimalistic markup to HTML. So in order to make a blog post I just add a file to the content/posts folder, run the python script and upload the result to my server (which currently happens to be GitHub pages, since they freely serve static sites). The generation of blog posts also spits out the Archive page.</p><p>One funky thing I added was support for LaTeX markup (via KaTeX). This makes it possible to have fancy maths in the posts, making stuff such as <a href="http://zylinski.se/post/everything_binomial.html">this post about everything binomial</a> possible. One thing I should do, but haven't, is to run the LaTeX generation offline as well, currently it is done using Javascript.</p><p>I think this setup has been very nice and it has opened my eyes to how often we overuse complicated dynamic websites and all the associated infrastructure.</p></div></div><div class='index_post'><a class='index_date' href='/post/saturday.html'>December  9, 2017</a><div class="post"><h1>Saturday</h1><p></p><p>A whining noise, modulating.
