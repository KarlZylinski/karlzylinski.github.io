<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>
    My name is Karl Zylinski and this is where I collect stuff I've made. There are <a href="writings.html">texts I've written</a>, <a href="games.html">games I've collaborated in making</a> and some other stuff.
</p>

<p>
    My recent jobs have been in game programming. At <a href="http://hazelight.se">Hazelight</a> I wrote code for their game A Way Out and at <a href="http://bitsquid.se">Bitsquid / Stingray</a> I made game creation tools.
</p>

<p>
    I currently study physics and astronomy at <a href="http://www.physics.uu.se/?languageId=1">Uppsala University</a>.
