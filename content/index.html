<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>
    My name is Karl Zylinski and I use this site for collecting projects of different kinds. There are video games I've collaborated in making, texts I've written and some other stuff.
</p>

<p>
    My recent jobs have been in game programming. At <a href="http://hazelight.se">Hazelight</a> I did gameplay and systems programming and at <a href="http://bitsquid.se">Bitsquid / Stingray</a> I made tools and engine code.
</p>

<p>
    I currently study physics and astronomy at <a href="http://www.physics.uu.se/?languageId=1">Uppsala University</a>.

<p>
    <a href="http://twitter.com/karl_zylinski">Twitter</a> is where I share my everyday serious and silly thougts. <a href="https://github.com/karl-zylinski">GitHub</a> is where many of my programming projects live.
