<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>
    I'm Karl Zylinski and I have quite a lot of hobbies. Primarily I like to tinker with many kinds of tech.
</p>

<p>
    My recent jobs have been in game programming. I currently do gameplay programming at <a href="http://hazelight.se">Hazelight</a>. Previously, I've made tools and engine code at <a href="http://bitsquid.se">Bitsquid</a>, which was acquired by Autodesk.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://twitter.com/KarlZylinski">Twitter</a> is where I write both serious and silly things and <a href="https://github.com/KarlZylinski">GitHub</a> is where I store my not-so-secret code.

    I have an e-mail address: <a href="mailto:karl@zylinski.se">karl@zylinski.se</a>.
