SPRE
On the edge,
but still far off.
Internal monologues
that could easily take lives.
This chatter, these screams
so frightening.
Forces, strong, keep these
propagating ideas at bay.

all this madness is secondary to
the primary directive.
Which is that you should
radiate outwards, onto those around you
an everlasting supply of kindness,
to always be aware when others hurt
and find the courage
to do something about it.
