#Internal tea luggage

DATE:May 24, 2017

SPRE
A stream, eager but not violent.
I have a huge internal energy cache and
the need to share words with a friend.
But I find myself walking down a path,
a thermos of tea as my only luggage.
Long past dusk, but the path still visible.

Across the stream a bridge was built.
Rocks thereunder suffice as chair.
The trees are green, my shoes are red,
shrouded in darkness all around me
these colors live their nightly life.

I brought no companion,
only this hot beverage
and my thoughts.

Minutes turn into an hour,
the tea runs out.

They'll never catch the wacko
sitting by the stream
alone at night
drinking tea
pondering life.
EPRE
