#I don't like rhymes

DATE:May 7, 2017

I don't like rhymes, especially in music.

Every time lyrics rhyme something in me stops and I think "could this song have been better without that rhyme?". Rhyming feels like a cheap trick to win points. I can't help but think that some other, more suiting combination of words could have been in it's place. But instead we settle for the the rhyme, which when placed in the lyrics almost feels untouchable, irremovable, because the structure of the music now depends on the sound of the lyrics, not the contents. This can of course be fine if the only thing we aim for is a specific feeling of sound, but otherwise it feels like the lyrics lose potential to mundane wordplay.
