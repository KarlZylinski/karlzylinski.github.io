#Flight

DATE:June 19, 2017

In the most complete empty darkness – no room, no walls, no sky, no stars – time did not pass. There was nothing that could tremble, nothing that could interact. Here, existence is undefinable and creation is both an event and nothing at all.

There, the void suddenly disturbed. With the help of light, a flight of stairs would have hung in the black. But there was only black. On the top step, a head. It wasn't conscious, wasn't alive. No motion was possible in this realm, not because it couldn't happen, but because no one and nothing had ever tried. The head tried.

Slowly, almost adamant, over the edge, down a step. No thud, a loud scream. "DEGELHE!" The steps now visible, still unreadable. If a void contains something totally red, it is just a smear. A new perspective required.

Lunge out into the void! See what the world looks like! A side-view. Like blood flowing down stairs, the stairs were nothing but a red silhouette against the darkness. "MAZDAGA!"

A crack formed, the head split open. There, down in the slush, the most beautiful colors could be seen. Twisting and turning, the stairs – the world! – compacted itself by swirling into a maelstrom and disappearing, sucked into the colorful pit. Closing. Darkness again. Rumbling, shaking! Ever more violently, paving way for the final deed.

Exploding – not splitting, but exploding – into millions of colors, the head vanished. It left behind the most intricate palette of colored matter – but the matter was sad, and stayed that way.
