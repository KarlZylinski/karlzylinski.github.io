#A missing friend

DATE:May 21, 2017

The mist lay like a thick blanket over the trees that surrounded him. The sky was dark, purple and a heavy yellow moon hung high above. At first everything was quiet, but gradually the wind began picking up speed until it howled and the light drizzle turned into rain that whipped and whipped against his skin. Lightning struck, many bolts, coming closer. He was getting very cold, shivering.

Suddenly there was a deafening sound, a blinding light and all around him the trees exploded into fire. "WHERE AM I?" he screamed, terrified. Lightning struck again and again, all around him. Eventually it formed a standing wall of vertical bolts, shaped like a circle, in which he was trapped. The fire roared on.

Everything felt surreal, he sat down on his knees, whimpering. From outside the wall of flames and bolts a hand reached out to him, as if it wanted him to grab it. He hesitated, and then went for it. He grabbed and pulled. The body to which the hand was attached flew towards him, and in the air the head looked up. It was scorched beyond recognition, no hair, the skin cracked and dry. He sat huddled in the middle of this ring of lightning and fire, screaming in horror, looking at what was the body of his long-gone friend.
