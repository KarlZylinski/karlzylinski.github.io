#Trent thinks about maturing

DATE:July 4, 2017

Trent sat at his kitchen table, reading. In the book a young couple fell in love, had children, broke up and were overall confused by how their life had turned out.

He put the book down and thought:

"Some people seem to think that finding the right person and having kids early in their life, say somewhere right after 22-23, is a great thing. But usually one goes through many transformations during the twenties. If you find the 'right' person at age 21, have kids and so on, the risk of you two becoming unhappy is greater than if you waited for life to transform you. Your values, what you want in life, how to handle the everydayness, will hopefully kind-of have sorted themselves out around 30, after your first 10 years as an 'adult'. By this age, what you hope to find in an ideal partner, will probably have changed vastly. You might be legally grown up at 20, but you don't really grow up until you perhaps move somewhere, try some new stuff, letting the world transform you for a couple of years."
