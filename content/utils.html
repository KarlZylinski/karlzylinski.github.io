<h1>Utils</h1>

<p>Just a bunch of utils and libs I've written over the years.</p>

<h2>pvx</h2>
<p>
    Minimalistic shape rendering system for interfacing with lua. The only thing it can do is draw colored shapes, process mouse input and process a few keys (escape and arrow keys). By compiling this as a dll or whatever silly thing you can do in your OS, you can then load it up from lua like so:
    <pre>
    package.loadlib(", "pvx_load")()</pre>
</p>

<p>
    This injects these global functions into your lua environment, which you can then use to draw graphics and process simple mouse input:
    <pre>
    pvx_init
    pvx_deinit
    pvx_process_events
    pvx_is_window_open
    pvx_add_shape
    pvx_draw_shape
    pvx_clear
    pvx_flip
    pvx_key_held
    pvx_move_view
    pvx_view_pos
    pvx_mouse_pos
    pvx_window_size
    pvx_left_mouse_held
    pvx_right_mouse_held</pre>
</p>

<p>
    The library is a simple 600 LOC thing written in C which just draws arbitrary colored shapes using OpenGL. It is used and written specically for my gamejam town AI simulation <a href="games.html#koffert">KOFFERT</a>, which is written in lua.

<h2>jzon</h2>
<p>
    jzon is a format for describing data that is easier and less error-prone to edit than standard json. It differs from normal json in these ways:
    <ul>
        <li>Quotes around keys are optional.</li>
        <li>Multi-line string support.</li>
        <li>Commas are optional.</li>
        <li>Explicit root node is optional.</li>
    </ul>
    I have made a C implementation of a reader for this data format.
