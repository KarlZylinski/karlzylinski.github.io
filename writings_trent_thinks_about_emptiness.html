        <h1>Trent thinks about emptiness</h1><p><em>July 4, 2017</em></p><p></p><p>Trent was out walking, feeling very alive and at ease, nothing in his head. It was a very pure and calm state. Just before heading out he had been reading at home, and every word had been absorbed, the mind like a blank canvas. There had been nothing veering his attention off course.</p><p>"I feel totally empty inside", Trent thought and then stopped walking, "hmm, that's weird!"</p><p>He started walking again, but in an amble, "that phrase is usually used when people have a really bad day, when they don't wanna do anything, are totally unreceptive to any information and even though something might sound worthwhile doing, they feel fatigued just thinking about it."</p><p>The walkway he strolled along passed through an area of small family houses. He stopped again, looked at a cat that was sitting in the grass. The cat looked back. He smiled and continued.</p><p>"Isn't it so, that whenever one says that they 'feel empty inside', what they actually mean is that their mind is so saturated by impressions that they feel exhausted? This feeling comes to me when when I have way too much to do, or sometimes after a terrible social gathering that took the juice out of me. Often when people feel like this, they try to push themselves, they are 'empty inside', so they <em>should</em> be able to to something productive anyways, <em>fill the emptiness!</em> But I think now that they are often just saturated with impressions and should probably lie down on a couch and have tea for the rest of the day."</p><p>"So in a way, the name is wrong. The emptiness I currently feel, this receptive state, is <em>true</em> emptiness, and it's the most brilliant state to be in. The other, horrible state is a <em>false</em> emptiness, or more correctly, a <em>saturatedness</em>."</p><p>He lounged into the supermarket, looked at some stuff but soon realized that he didn't even need anything and left empty-handed.</p>
