but still far off.
Internal monologues
that could easily take lives.
This chatter, these screams
everlastingly frightening.
Forces, strong, keep these
propagating ideas at bay.</p><p>Simply put, these forces are that
all this madness is secondary to
the primary directive:
You should radiate outwards
onto those around you
an everlasting supply of kindness,
to always be aware when others hurt
and find the courage
to do something about it.
