On the edge,
but still far off.
Internal monologues
that could easily take lives.
This chatter, these screams
everlastingly frightening.
Forces, strong, keep these
propagating ideas at bay.

Simply put, these forces are that
all this madness is secondary to
the primary directive:
You should radiate outwards
onto those around you
an everlasting supply of kindness,
to always be aware when others hurt
and find the courage
to do something about it.
