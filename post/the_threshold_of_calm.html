        <div class='standalone_post'><div class='standalone_date'>May 9, 2017</div><h1>The threshold of calm</h1><p></p><p>I like taking walks, for many reasons. Maybe I was fed up with whatever I was doing, maybe I needed some air.</p><p>Sometimes I take walks because it feels like there's something heavy inside my chest, a kind of unrest. At those moments I try taking really deep breaths, because it feels like it might help. It feels like the depth of my breaths—how filled my lungs get—have a threshold. It feels like if a single breath was to get past that threshold, the heavy feeling would subside.</p><p>So it's not unusual for me to find myself walking around, breathing deeply, focused, hunting for that threshold. If I'm unlucky, the heaviness stays. But in a few cases, after walking around outside for a couple of minutes, I successfully inhale so deeply that the threshold is overwon and during the following exhale I feel a big, fuzzy calm take hold of me.</p><p>I like those moments.</p></div>
