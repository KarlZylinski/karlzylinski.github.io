        <div class='standalone_post'><div class='standalone_date'>May 2, 2017</div><h1>Habits, hands, Bamse</h1><p></p><p>It's often said that it takes a couple of weeks to create a new habit or destroy an old one. This is often pointed out as some kind of self-help-thumb-rule. However, imagine jumping straight out of bed, standing on one hand for a minute while singing the theme music for Swedish kids-television-show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jePUt1FIiUE">Bamse</a>. Now imagine doing this every day for ten years. After these ten years, it would very hard to stop doing this, even though it's the dumbest and weirdest shit ever.</p></div>
